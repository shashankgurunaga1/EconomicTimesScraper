The industry --- which witnessed the first full year without any impact of COVID-19 in FY23 after a gap of two years with double-digit growth of 21 per cent in overall retail sales -- is now set to clock tapered growth in the low single-digit due to a high base, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA). As per data shared by the dealers\\' body, the total domestic vehicle retail sales stood at 2,21,50,222 units in FY23 against 18,3,27,326 units in FY22. Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Officer, Marketing and Sales, Shashank Srivastava said the unseasonal rains in March and early April could have a dampening effect on the sentiment in the rural areas. \"Because this is the harvest time and these rains are not so good (for the rural sales),\" he told PTI. Similarly, FADA said, \"The untimely rains and hailstorms in north and central India have destroyed key rabi crops and delayed harvesting, (and) will have a negative impact on rural sales\". Another concern for automakers is the high-interest rates on automobile loans. \"The interest rates continue to be high,\" Srivastava said, adding since the rate tightening cycle started by the RBI in May 2022, the repo rate has gone up from 4 per cent to 6.5 per cent. He further said, \"And what we have found is that the transmission of the repo rates into the auto loan rates has been almost complete. There are different banks which have increased between 180 basis points to 250 basis points\". With auto loans constituting 80 per cent of the total retail in the industry, Srivastava said, \"Any increase in the auto loan rates obviously has a negative impact and that is the other factor which we are looking at\". For domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales, Srivastava said the estimated sales would be \"somewhere between 4.05 million to 4.1 million in FY24\" at a growth of 5-7 per cent over FY23. Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd Managing Director Shailesh Chandra said the growth rate of the passenger vehicle industry may \"moderate due to a strong base effect as well as macro factors, including hardening interest rates, rising inflation and the cost impact from progressive regulatory norms\". PV prices have gone up due to increased costs to meet the real-time driving emission norms under BS-VI phase II. Also, the mandatory six airbags norms coming in from October this year will further increase costs. \"The price increases in response to both the commodity price increases and the regulatory requirements could lead to adverse impact on the demand projections,\" Srivastava said. FADA on its outlook for the low single-digit growth of vehicle sales said it is \"due to a high base, inflationary pressures, routine price hikes and regulatory changes\". Additionally, it said, there have been predictions of the possibility of El Nino\\'s arrival later this year, \"which could lead to poor monsoons, hampering rural India\\'s growth potential\".', 'Credit growth continued to outpace deposit growth in FY\\'23 at an eleven year high even as banks have transmitted fully -250 bps - their lending rates linked to external benchmarks which now comprise almost half of floating rate loans. Credit demand may not be linked to interest rates but more to economic activity, notings in the RBI\\'s monetary policy report suggest.While bank loans rose 14.6 percent in FY\\'23, deposits rose just 9.6 percent. Credit growth in the last fiscal is the highest since FY\\'2011-12 during which credit rose 17 percent. Significantly, lending rates rose the steepest in FY\\'23.Banks revised upwards their external benchmark-based lending rates (EBLRs) by 250 bps between May 2022- March 2023. in tandem with the increase in the policy repo rate. The marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) – the internal benchmark for loan pricing – rose by 140 bps over the same period. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on sanctioned fresh rupee loans increased by 173 bps and that on outstanding rupee loans by 95 bps between May 2022 to February 2023The external benchmark linked loans now account for the largest share among floating rate loans, with their share increasing from 44.0 per cent in March 2022 to 48.3 per cent in December 2022. Correspondingly, the share of MCLR-linked loans declined from 48.6 percent to 46.1 per cent over the same period.Within EBLR loans, the RBI’s repo rate is the preferred benchmark, with a share of 81 per cent of all EBLR linked loans at end-December 2022. \"The significant increase in the share of repo linked loans with shorter reset periods aided the pace of transmission to WALR on outstanding loans\" RBI said.An econometric analysis of monthly non-food credit and deposit data of all commercial banks for the period April 2007-December 2022 by the Reserve Bank shows that bank deposits and credit comove over time or in other words move in tandem. \"The credit growth is driven by a rebound in economic activity and is supported by an improvement in deposit growth\" RBI said in its latest MPR.\" Bank credit expected to grow by 15% in fiscal 2024, supported by revival in corporate credit\" said a report by crating firm Crisil. \" Leading indicators point to continued downtrend in gross NPAs and could touch 3.8% by March 2024\"Even ratings firms seem to agree with Reserve Bank. \" Credit growth is expected to be in sync with the GDP growth in FY24\" said a report by Care Edge Ratings. \" Further, a slowdown in global growth due to rising interest rates, and rate hikes in India could impact credit growth\".The current pace of lending growth may not be alarmist. \"Despite the buoyancy in bank credit in 2022-23, the credit-to-GDP gap remains negative\" RBI said in its latest monetary policy report.', 'Industry body COAI has asserted that operators are mindful of adhering to service quality as they roll out 5G, but added that full benefits of seamless urban-rural connectivity of fifth-generation services will be gained once pan-India availability of these networks is achieved. The speed of 5G rollout in India \"is the fastest in the world\", SP Kochhar, Director General of Cellular Operators\\' Association of India (COAI) said.  \"When the rollout is taking place in a phased manner, that is, in urban areas first, followed by rural, and not in a heterogeneous manner - the overall benefits of 5G will take some time to arrive,\" Kochhar told PTI.  5G services, in locations rolled out already, are meeting the scientific parameters of ultra high-speed network.  \"Wherever 5G is being rolled out, telecom operators are being very careful that they adhere to quality, as it is in their interest to do so, and the competition is so stiff that they don\\'t want to lose out the business. So they will come out with the best quality, and that they are doing,\" Kocchar said.  5G services which promise turbocharged speeds far greater than 4G, and ultra low latency connectivity, have been rolled out in hundreds of cities in India by telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. According to Kochhar, while players are fully conscious of service quality, some ground realities have to be kept in mind.  \"But a seamless connectivity experience spanning both urban and rural areas might take some time...till the time the entire country gets covered with 5G,\" he said.  Kochhar added: \"Whether it is 4G or 5G there are terrains and obstacles, so obviously you cannot have same quality in all areas. Where there are no obstacles you get a better quality, where there are obstacles, the quality may take some time to pick up.\"  5G networks launched in October are up and running in many locations, and while the service quality norms for these new-age offerings are being worked out, curtailing call drops and improving consumer experience for telecom services in general have been under the government and regulator\\'s constant focus.  The telecom department back in December met operators to discuss rising instances of call drops and service quality-related issues in existing services, as it deliberated on policy measures that can be considered for improving call quality.  Telecom regulator TRAI also called a meeting with telcos in February to discuss measures and action plan for improving service quality, review of norms, as also benchmarks for 5G services.', \"The government is likely to set up the 16th finance commission this year to suggest, among other things, the ratio in which tax is to be divided between the Centre and states for five years, beginning April 1, 2026, an official said. The members of the commission and its Terms of Reference (ToR) are being worked out, the official added. Finance Commission is a constitutional body that gives suggestions on Centre-state financial relations. The previous Finance Commission submitted its report on November 9, 2020, for the 5 fiscals -- 2021-22 to 2025-26 -- to the President. The 15th Commission under NK Singh had kept the tax devolution ratio at 42 per cent -- at the same level suggested by the 14th Commission. The central government accepted the report of the commission, and accordingly, the states are being given 42 per cent of the divisible tax pool of the Centre during the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. The 15th finance commission's recommendations include the fiscal deficit, debt path for the Union and states, and additional borrowing room to states based on performance in power sector reforms. As per the glide path for fiscal consolidation, the government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2025-26 fiscal. For the current fiscal, the deficit is projected at 5.9 per cent of GDP, lower than 6.4 per cent in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2023.\", '\"Why would the stakeholders of Maruti Suzuki jeopardise their interest by allowing me to continue if I don’t bring value to the table?” asks RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki. At the age of 88, he retains an advisory role in the country’s biggest carmaker and scoffs at the very idea of retirement. He is also on the board of Dabur and has recently taken a board seat at Escorts Kubota although he has given up board positions outside Delhi to avoid long-distance travel.While most professionals call it a day in their mid- to late-fifties when the age of superannuation strikes, there is a lengthening list of corporate honchos who refuse to tire or retire in their 60s and work in their 70s and even 80s. After occupying important board positions and leading large organisations for years, they say 58 is not an age to retire.It is not just about financial benefits, they say. Many admit it is tough to not have a major work commitment to wake up to every morning after years of hectic work schedules, travel and meetings. “We just can’t switch off! How do you pass the day otherwise, having lived an active life?” asks Bhargava, who advises the company on government relations, strategy and policy.  “I did not see retirement as the end of work. It was a moment I moved on from Unilever to other commercial activities. It was also an opportunity to give back to the world,” says Manvinder Singh Banga, 68. The former chairman of HUL is senior partner at the private equity fund Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and chair of UK Government Investments. “I would like to contribute to business and society for as long as possible,” he says. Arundhati Bhattacharya, 67, agrees. The former chairperson of the State Bank of India is now the CEO of the India division of Salesforce. “If professionals at private banks and corporates are allowed to be at the helm till 70, why make an exception for PSU banks? That’s hardly a levelplaying field then,” she says. “As for me, I took a few months to agree to take on this role. It keeps challenging me and helps me learn and evolve. Sixty is not an age for retirement if one has the energy and good health to work. For instance, I take calls as early as 5:30 in the morning or past 11:30 at night since it is a US-headquartered company.”If your body and mind are ticking, then why quit — is the question they ask. “If your mind is working, it is an indication you are not becoming senile,” says Bhargava. However, a top Indian promoter, who stepped down in his 50s, says most people in the corporate sector want to be seen and heard even in their later years, even after retirement. “My view is that after a certain age, you should be seen and not heard. Give space to the next generation,” he says.Not everyone agrees.“When people ask me about hanging up my boots, I tell them it is really about changing my socks,” says Sanjiv Mehta, who will step down from his role as CEO of HUL on June 26. The Unilever brigade is known to be much-sought-after post retirement. And Mehta is no exception. He will be stepping into the board of Danone in July. “Today life expectancy has gone up. Our health is good and, so, we are able to contribute in a meaningful way. Take PM Narendra Modi, for instance, or US President Joe Biden or Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffet who are still working. Everyone should find one’s own balance at every stage of life,” says Mehta.RETIREMENT AGE NO BARWork doesn’t pause with retirement for talented executives who are eagerly invited by conglomerates and institutions that are only happy to get their expertise and add them to their boards. “If Amitabh Bachchan can work at 80, why can’t I at 58?” asks a top corporate professional in jest and seeking anonymity. It could be tempting to say ‘yes’ to every opportunity that comes your way post-retirement, but that will be a mistake. Plan, says Pawan Goenka. “Good planning, while still employed, can be fulfilling for a balanced next chapter,” says the 68-year-old who retired as the MD of M&M in April 2021. Five months later, in September, he was appointed as the chairperson of the Indian National Space Promotion Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), an autonomous agency under the Department of Space. He also chairs the Steering Committee on Advancing Local valueadd & Exports (SCALE) under the commerce ministry and is on the board of companies like Bosch and Sun Pharma. After his stint at IN-SPACe which ends in 2024, Goenka says he might slow down a bit but will never fully retire as long as he is in good health.Post-retirement trajectory may not be easy. Even if some might want to slow down the pace, they are not quite keen on relinquishing the prestige and self-worth that they enjoyed in a full-time executive role. Rajiv Vij, life and executive coach who works with CXOs of large organisations, says post-retirement phase can be a time of confusion and uncertainty for many senior corporate leaders as they suddenly climb down from the peak of their careers and lose power and status. “It requires planning,” he says. Most of them want to lead a “balanced life”, he adds, as they give up P&L responsibility. They get involved in the social sector or mentor small businesses to scale up, says Vij, who was an MD with Franklin Templeton Investments. Banga says he chooses to “work in areas that are challenging, stimulating and satisfying”. “That is a big part of my well-being and I am able to combine that with the activities I enjoy, like spending time with my family and travelling.” Contentment is important. For Arun Nanda, 75, after nearly 40 years of a satisfying career in a senior leadership role in the Mahindra Group, it is about giving back to society. “I was very clear that I wanted to commit a significant part of my remaining life to help the aged as I was drawn to the challenge of loneliness faced by senior citizens,” he says. It has led to the formation of the Adhata Trust, a social initiative for the welfare of seni o r citizens. “The best gift I have ever got is contentment. That is why I never looked at joining outside boards.”Nanda, who feels that the more you work, the younger you stay, has brought down the number of boards he is on: from 12 in 2012 to just three in the Mahindra Group.“By working, we not only keep ourselves engaged but also bring value by leveraging our skills and experience as the challenges of end-to-end business and risk management apply to all companies,” says Goenka. Startups have tremendous passion and risk-taking ability but they often lack experience. Someone with grey hair may help them navigate better, he adds.Says R Gopalakrishnan, 74, former director of Tata Sons and former VC of Unilever: “As long as one is physically and mentally fit, one should keep oneself occupied. I figured that my mindset should pivot from reTire to reFire.The question was how to reFire after a 48-year corporate career with its own routines and trappings.” He is now chairman of Castrol India and independent director of Press Trust of India. “My view developed in the years before I stepped down from the Tata board: that I should share my wealth of experience and learnings to the point of emptying myself,” he says. “But one should also keep evolving, refiring to contribute meaningfully, else both the company and you will suffer.”', '', 'Indian equities in a holiday-shortened week ended Thursday’s session higher as the RBI announced a pause in rate hike. The move lifted domestic equities sentiment, with Nifty ending at 17,599 points. Sectorally, FMCG, IT and consumer durables ended in the red, while all others ended higher. Markets remained closed on Friday on account of Good Friday.Here\\'s how analysts read the market pulse:\"The surprising policy move to pause interest rate hikes has had a convincing effect on bond yields and the stock market. A plausible peaking of the interest rate will have a positive effect on the financial markets, which was reflected in today’s drop in yield and marginal upside of the domestic stock market when the Asian market was negative. However, the trend to continue during the year will depend on a consistent fall in inflation, which is forecasted to stay elevated above the FY24 target. Given the high gap between current and target inflation, the RBI will have to hold the rates high for a long period, limiting the upside,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.“After witnessing a 700 points rally in the last five trading sessions a consolidation is highly likely. Thus, considering the above factors we expect the Nifty to consolidate over the next few trading sesisons and any dip towards the support zone of 17500 – 17430 should be used as an opportunity to create fresh long positions,” Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday’s action:US stocks end quiet session higherWall Street stocks finished a quiet session mostly higher on Thursday, concluding a holiday-shortened trading week that has included weakening economic data.Reports earlier in the week showed a softening in the labor market, a contraction in the manufacturing sector and slowing growth in services.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat at 33,485.29.The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 4,105.02, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite index advanced 0.8 percent to 12,087.96.European shares rise as banking gainsEuropean shares rose on Thursday, heading into a long Easter weekend break, as real estate and travel stocks helped outweigh concerns over a U.S. economic slowdown that were triggered by lacklustre data.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%, posting its third consecutive weekly gain, with banking stocks among the biggest boosts.After a strong start to the year, European equities remained under selling pressure from last month as the recent banking turmoil kept the risk sentiment fragile, with skittish investors fretting about mixed economic data and a looming recession.Tech View: Positive candleA reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates a breather type movement in the market at the hurdle after a sharp upside movement from the lows recently.Stocks showing bullish biasMomentum indicator Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed bullish trade on the counters of ITC, Vakrangee, Equitas SFB, Adani Power and JaiPrakash Associates among others.The MACD is known for signaling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.Stocks signaling weakness aheadThe MACD showed bearish signs on the counters of PB Fintech, Zen Technologies, Aster DM Healthcare, SRF and CCL Products among others.Bearish crossover on the MACD on these counters indicated that they have just begun their downward journey.Most active stocks in value termsHDFC Bank (Rs 3703 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 2291 crore), RIL (Rs 1992 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 1681 crore) and HDFC (Rs 1436 crore) were among the most active stocks on NSE in value terms. Higher activity on a counter in value terms can help identify the counters with highest trading turnovers in the day.Most active stocks in volume termsVodafone Idea (Shares traded: 8.76 crore), Yes Bank (Shares traded: 6.9 crore), IEX (Shares traded: 4.41 crore), BHEL (Shares traded: 3.64 crore) and PNB((Shares traded: 3.39 crore) were among the most traded stocks in the session on NSE.Stocks showing buying interestShares of Ramkrishna Forgings, Cholamandalam Investment, Anupam Rasayan, JBM Auto and IGL among others witnessed strong buying interest from market participants as they scaled their fresh 52-week highs, signaling bullish sentiment.Stocks seeing selling pressureShares of Orient Electric, SCI, V Mart Retail and Mirza International among others hit their 52-week lows, signaling bearish sentiment on the counters.Sentiment meter favours bullsOverall, market breadth favoured bulls as 2,393 stocks ended in the green, while 1133 names settled with cuts.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The Madhya Pradesh shuttler, who was part of the Indian team that registered an epic win at the 2022 Thomas Cup, saw off world number 49 Johannesen 21-15 19-21 21-16 in a 68-minute summit clash to grab the biggest title of his career.  \"I am very happy with my performance this week. It is my first big title and I\\'m extremely happy to win this,\" world no. 58 Rajawat, who is likely to get into top 40 after this win, told PTI from Orleans.  The two shuttlers, making it to the final after coming through the qualifiers, dished out some superb badminton, but the Indian rode on his ability to produce winners to secure the world tour super 300 crown.  It was the first meeting between the two 21-year-olds, both looking for a breakthrough win but Rajawat, who didn\\'t drop a game in the USD 240,000 tournament, showed his maturity as he dished out a controlled aggressive game to come up trumps.  The image of an airborne Rajawat unleashing a forehand crosscourt jump smash to trouble his opponent will be etched in the mind of the spectators, as he accumulated multiple points with this trademark shot.  A year ago, Rajawat had returned early from Orleans when it was a super 100 event, but the tournament was upgraded to super 300 from this year, and the Indian made the most of the opportunity.  Rajawat, who picked up the sport as a six-year-old, dished out his range of strokes to move to 6-5 with two aggressive returns on the left-handed Dane\\'s backhand. A backhand smash and another winner saw him lead 11-8 at the interval.  The Indian showed great anticipation, which allowed him to get into position early and bring down the shuttle with a thwack. Two cross-court smashes helped the Indian create a yawning gap at 18-11, which the Dane couldn\\'t bridge.  After the change of sides, Johannesen strengthened his defence while Rajawat botched up some of his shots to allow the Dane lead 6-3 as he went into the break with a three-point cushion this time.  Rajawat fell into a pool of errors to allow the Dane increase the gap to 14-9. He clawed back at 17-15, producing some accurate winners but Johannesen jumped to three game points.  The Indian saved two before conceding one at the net as the Dane took the match to the decider.  In the third game, Rajawat zoomed to 7-2 after producing a series of winners but Johannesen narrowed it down to 7-8 after winning an incredible 54-shot rally. The Dane drew parity at 9-9 but the Indian managed to gain a small two-point cushion after producing two winners.  After the final changeover, Rajawat got a second wind as he extended his lead to four points after winning another superb rally. He kept the rallies in his firm grip and soon grabbed seven championship points with another cross-court smash.  He converted on his fourth attempt and lifted his hand in celebration.  \"In the second game I was little tired and ended up making mistakes. My coach (N Anil Kumar) told me not to think too much and just keep the shuttle inside the court,\" Rajawat said.  \"I recovered from 9-14 down but a small mistake cost me the second game. In the third game, I was able to keep the mistakes low. I knew if I can keep it simple, he will give me points.\"  Rajawat\\'s growing up years and influences  =========================  Rajawat started playing the game following his brother Krunal. He was interested in football for a brief time but then badminton took over and soon he found himself in the Pullela Gopichand Academy in Gwalior.  \"I was there for two years but then Gopi sir called me to Hyderabad and I have been training there since 8 year old,\" said Rajawat.  In Hyderabad, Rajawat had the fortune of watching the cream of Indian badminton in action. Be it Kidambi Srikanth or HS Prannoy, training with them shaped his game.  \"I grew up watching videos of Lin Dan and Gopi sir and then when I started training, there was Srikanth bhaiyya, Sameer bhaiyya, Prannoy bhaiyya, all of them had an influence on my game. The sessions I had with them helped me immensely and their success also motivated me a lot.\"  Rajawat, who had a runner-up finish at Odisha Open in 2022, won the BAI trials to make it to the Thomas Cup team. He then won the Raipur International Challenge and finished second at Bangladesh Open in December.', \"Amid rising COVID-19 cases, a nationwide mock drill to take stock of hospital preparedness will be held on April 10 and 11 in which both public and private facilities are expected to participate. Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya will visit AIIMS, Jhajjar on April 10 to oversee the mock drill, officials said on Sunday. In a review meeting held on April 7, Mandaviya had urged state health ministers to visit hospitals and oversee the mock drills. He had also advised them to review the preparedness with district administrations and health officials on April 8 and 9. In the meeting with state health ministers, and principal and additional chief secretaries held virtually, Mandaviya had stressed the need to identify emergency hotspots by monitoring trends of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases, ramping up testing and vaccination, and ensuring readiness of hospital infrastructure. Besides enhancing genome sequencing and ramping up whole genome sequencing of positive samples, he had emphasised creating awareness about following Covid-appropriate behaviour. During the meeting, states and union territories were informed that currently the World Health Organisation (WHO) is closely tracking a variant of interest (VOI), XBB.1.5, and six other variants are under monitoring (BQ.1, BA.2.75, CH.1.1, XBB, XBF and XBB.1.16), a health ministry statement had said. It was highlighted that while Omicron and its sub-lineages continue to be the predominant variants, most of the assigned variants have little or no significant transmissibility, disease severity or immune escape. The prevalence of XBB.1.16 increased from 21.6 per cent in February to 35.8 per cent in March. However, no evidence of an increase in hospitalisation or mortality has been reported, the statement said. During the meeting, it was observed that 23 states and union territories had average tests per million below the national average. Mandaviya had said that irrespective of the new variants, the five-fold strategy of 'Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and adherence to Covid-Appropriate Behaviour' continues to remain the tested strategy for Covid management. States and union territories were also requested to expeditiously increase the rate of testing from 100 tests per million as on the week ending April 7. They were further advised to increase the share of RT-PCR in tests.\", 'The bell installed on the first INS Vikrant which was part of the Indian Navy from 1961 for 36 years, has now been returned to the country\\'s latest and first \\'Made-in-India\\' aircraft carrier of the same name commissioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.The bell was on the first INS Vikrant in 1961 after India bought a British-origin aircraft carrier HMS Hercules and gave it an Indian name.\"The bell was on the first INS Vikrant which served till 1997 before getting decommissioned. The bell was later out from there and put up at the earmarked residence of Indian Navy Vice Chief 5, Motilal Nehru Marg,\" the Navy officials told ANI.Traditionally bells have played an important role on both warships as they help in indicating the time to the sailors and officers performing different duties and also during emergencies, the officers said.The bell was returned to the INS Vikrant by retired Vice Chief of Navy Vice Admiral SN Ghormade on March 22 last month.The officials said the previous Vice Chief decided to return the bell as the force has got its maiden \\'Made-in-India\\' indigenous aircraft carrier and would serve a better purpose there to motivate youth about the rich history of their ship and the Indian Navy.The traditional bell has been part of a glorious history as it was there on the warship when it played a crucial role in bombarding Pakistan in 1971 and blockading the Karachi harbour.The warship was very active during the wars India fought against Pakistan and was deployed at key locations to further the security of the nation.The new warship INS Vikrant was commissioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 2, last year at Kochi making it the first indigenously built aircraft carrier for the country.The warship is carrying out trials for the operations of the fighter aircraft from its deck and is likely to get fully operational anytime soon now. ', 'The road transport and highways sector has the maximum number of delayed projects at 407, followed by railways at 114 and the petroleum industry at 86, showed a government report. In the road transport and highways sector, 407 out of 717 projects are delayed. For railways, out of 173 projects, 114 are delayed, while in the petroleum sector, 86 out of 146 projects are running behind schedule, as per the latest flash report on infrastructure projects for February 2023. The Infrastructure and Project Monitoring Division (IPMD) is mandated to monitor central sector infrastructure projects costing Rs 150 crore and above based on the information provided on the Online Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) by the project implementing agencies. The IPMD comes under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The report showed that the Muneerabad-Mahaboobnagar rail project is the most delayed. It is delayed by 276 months. The second-most delayed project is the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail project, which is delayed by 247 months. The third-most delayed project, Belapur-Seawood-Urban Electrified Double Line, is running 228 months behind schedule.

Alleging that the State\\'s milk production had been affected since the day Union Cooperative Minister Amit Shah spoke about the possibility of merging the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) with Amul, the former Chief Minister in a series of tweets asked the Prime Minister what his role had been in this. Amul\\'s move is being seen by many, especially opposition parties, as a threat to KMF\\'s famed dairy brand \\'Nandini\\'. They also see it as an attempt to trample upon KMF, amid a narrative around its merger with Amul. \"Is your purpose of coming to Karnataka to give to Karnataka or to loot from Karnataka? You have already stolen banks, ports and airports from Kannadigas. Are you now trying to steal Nandini (KMF) from us?\" Siddaramaiah asked. \"It was Gujarat\\'s Baroda Bank that subsumed our Vijaya Bank. Ports and Airports were handed over to Gujarat\\'s Adani. Now, Amul from Gujarat is planning to eat our KMF (Nandini). Mr Narendra Modi, Are we the enemies for Gujaratis?\" Instead of giving 2 crore jobs a year to youths, Narendra Modi took away the jobs of Kannadigas from our banks, ports and airports, he further said, adding that \"Now Karnataka BJP wants to hurt the prospects of our farmers by giving KMF to Amul.\" Modi was in Mysuru and Chamarajanagara districts to attend an event commemorating 50 years of \\'Project Tiger\\'. The attacks from Siddaramaiah came despite Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday clarifying in this regard. Calling \\'Nandini\\' the pride of Karnataka, and stating that his government had taken all kinds of measures to make it number one at the national level, Bommai said, \"Nandini\\'s market reach is wide, there is no need to fear Amul.\" Congress politicising everything is not in the interest of the state, he had said. \"We are also going to other states and marketing....we will do all that is required to put Amul behind in the competition.\" State Cooperation Minister S T Somashekar on Sunday reiterated that there was no proposal to merge KMF with Amul. \"If Amul sells milk online at Rs 57 per litre, we sell it at Rs 39. We are sending our products to Tamil Nadu and other states,\" he said, adding that it was impossible to erase the Nandini brand. State BJP General Secretary C N Ashwathnarayan criticised former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah of Congress and H D Kumaraswamy of JDS for making \"irresponsible statements\" on the issue. Stating that it was clear that Amul was trying to indulge in unnecessary competition with KMF and was planning to trample Nandini day by day, Kumaraswamy had said \"Unhealthy competition between well-known sister organisations in the cooperative sector is not in anyone\\'s interest. KMF directly buys milk from farmers through cooperative societies in thousands of villages in the state.\"', 'Adani Power Limited (APL), the largest private thermal power producer in India, has commissioned its first 800 MW ultra-super-critical thermal power generation unit at Godda in the Jharkhand district and begun supplying 748 MW of power to neighbouring Bangladesh, the company said today.“The Godda power plant is a strategic asset in the India-Bangladesh’s long-standing relationship,” said SB Khyalia, CEO, Adani Power Limited, adding that the power plant will ease power supply in Bangladesh, making its industries and ecosystem more competitive.\"It is going to be the most efficient and environment-friendly thermal power plant installed in India and the entire South-East region and also one of the best in class in the world,\" he said.The Godda Power Plant comprises two units of the latest technology available in the world, which is ultra super critical technology with latest techniques for controlling emissions and consumption of coal and water.The company added that it is the first power plant in the country, which has started its operations with 100% flue gas desulphurization (FGD), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and zero water discharge.The FGD and SCR have been installed in the plant to minimise the emission and meet the latest environment norms of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.In November 2017, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) executed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with APL’s wholly-owned subsidiary Adani Power Jharkhand Limited (APJL) to procure 1,496 MW net capacity power from 2X800 MW ultra-supercritical power project at Godda. India’s largest power producer in the private sector is expected to commission its second 800 MW unit soon.Bangladesh has one of the largest liquid fuel-based power generation plants in the Indian sub-continent region. The installed capacity of heavy fuel oil (HFO)-based plants is about 6,329 MW and high-speed diesel (HSD)-based plants is about 1,290 MW, totaling to over 7,600 MW.As per BPDB’s annual report for the financial year 2021-22, the total tariff of HFO-based plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 22.10/kWh and total tariff of HSD-based power plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 154.11/kWh, which is far higher than the tariff of Godda Power Plant (Energy cost estimated to be around 9 cents/KWh). Though at present, Bangladesh has long-term PPA ties with three other imported coal-based generators, total tariff of Godda TPP is competitive compared to peers, the company said.APJL had synchronised the first unit with the power grid of Bangladesh on 29 November 2022 through a dedicated transmission line from Godda to Bangladesh.Subsequently, the requisite transmission evacuation system on the Bangladesh side was commissioned in March 2023. Accordingly, APJL again synchronised unit 1 on 20 March 2023. The Reliability Run Test, including Commercial Operation Tests, was completed on 5 April 2023 in the presence of authorities from BPDB and Power Grid Corporation of Bangladesh (PGCB) officials.Adani Power has an installed thermal power capacity of 13,610 MW spread across seven power plants in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh, apart from a 40 MW solar power plant in Gujarat.', \"Tesla Inc will build a factory in Shanghai to make the Megapack energy storage product, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported on Sunday. Elon Musk's automaker will break ground on the plant in the third quarter and start production in the second quarter of 2024, Xinhua reported from a signing ceremony in Shanghai. Complementing a huge existing Shanghai plant making electric vehicles, the new factory will initially produce 10,000 Megapack units a year, equal to around 40 gigawatt hours of energy storage, to be sold globally, Xinhua said. With the new Shanghai plant, Tesla will take advantage of China's world leading battery supply chain to ramp up output and lower costs of its Megapack lithium-ion battery units to meet rising demand of energy storage globally as the world shifts to use more renewable energy. Tesla generates most of its money from its electric car business, but Musk has committed to grow its solar energy and battery business to roughly the same size. Chinese battery giant CATL has also been deepening its collaborations with clients including Tesla in energy storage battery supplies, which its Chairman Robin Zeng expected to have a larger market than batteries powering electric vehicles (EV). Tesla currently has a Megafactory in Lathrop, California, capable of manufacturing 10,000 Megapacks per year. The company began producing Model 3 cars in Shanghai in 2019 and now is capable of producing 22,000 units of cars per week. Tesla planned to expand the Gigafactory Shanghai, its most productive automaking plant, to add an annual capacity of 450,000 units, Reuters reported last May. The U.S. company, however, had grappled with rising inventory in Shanghai as demand started weakening in the third quarter, leading to aggressive price cuts in its major markets globally in January. EV sales growth in China, the world's largest auto market, has slowed to 20.8% in the first two months of 2023, from 150% in the same period a year ago. \", 'With the prices of Alphonso mangoes eye-wateringly high, a trader in the city is offering the king of fruits on Equated Monthly Instalments or EMI. If refrigerators and air-conditioners can be purchased on instalments, why not mangoes, reasons Gaurav Sanas of Gurukripa Traders and Fruit Products. Alphonso or \\'Hapus\\' mangoes from Devgad and Ratnagiri, considered to be the best, are currently being sold at Rs 800 to 1300 per dozen in the retail market. Speaking to PTI, Sanas claimed that his family\\'s outlet is the first to sell mangos on EMI in the whole country. \"The prices are always very high at the start of the season. We thought if refrigerators, ACs and other appliances can be bought on EMI, why not mangoes? Everyone can afford mangoes then,\" he said. The procedure for buying the fruit at his outlet on EMI is similar to buying mobile phones on instalments. The customer needs to use a credit card and the purhcase amount is converted into EMIs of three, six or 12 months. But the scheme is available for a minimum purchase of Rs 5,000. Four consumers have availed of the scheme so far, Sanas said.', 'Several startups and ecommerce companies are likely to freeze salaries for senior management during appraisals as they step up cost-cutting measures to survive a harsh funding environment.As pressure mounts to conserve cash, founders, investors and human resources experts told ET that many startups will hold back raises for senior staff this year. At some companies, including those undergoing layoffs, top management may take pay cuts as well, they said.At February-end, ecommerce firm Flipkart announced that it would be freezing increments for the top 30% employees, including senior leadership, as it sought to be prudent in managing resources amid tough macroeconomic conditions. Edtech firm Unacademy, which has undertaken four rounds of layoffs, announced in its latest cost-cutting initiative that the leadership would take pay cuts up to 25%.“The ecosystem is not making money; it’s a logical move. Companies will have to figure out how to manage costs; job cuts alone are not enough to control the burn rate,” said Anshuman Das, managing partner, Longhouse Consulting.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 StoriesAbout 20-30% of employees at many of these firms will not get hikes this year, a compensation consultant told ET. “Cash flow is in question. Companies will do whatever it takes to conserve cash, especially after the huge hikes given during the boom in the sector in the last couple of years,” said the consultant, who did not wish to be identified.Sandeep Murthy, partner at venture capital fund Lightbox Ventures, said downturns are a great time to build businesses as many companies look to “do more with less”. This applies first and foremost to senior management, who are incentivised by long-term value creation in the business via ESOPs, he said. When funding becomes tight, management reduces their cash pay to ensure that the company can weather the storm and come out on the other end alive and ideally stronger.“We’ve lived through this cycle before and it is no surprise to me that this is happening now. In our portfolio many CEOs and other senior staff that are aligned with equity-based compensation have taken pay cuts and are working to create personal and company value through equity,” said Murthy.He cited the example of Zeno Health, where the founders have not taken an increment and have deferred a portion of their cash compensation as they work to bring the business to profitability.The CEO of another edtech firm, which has its appraisal cycle coming up, said it was unlikely that senior management would get hikes. “We are being careful with costs and senior management will lead from the front,” said the chief executive.While sectors such as edtech and crypto are the hardest-hit, even companies in a more stable position are actively pruning costs. The industry has been struggling with slowing funding, sinking valuations and thousands of layoffs.The CEO of another startup said he is circumspect despite having recently raised funding. He too said a salary freeze is likely for senior executives, though a final decision is yet to be taken. The startup has seen a slowing down in demand in the past few months and it’s important to conserve money, given there is no visibility on how long the slowdown will continue, he said.“Last year’s hikes were extraordinary… they weren’t grounded in reality. This year, we need to be conservative with cash,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.', 'The government has specified the retail sale price-based GST cess rate that would be levied on pan masala and tobacco manufacturers with effect from April 1. This is a departure from the earlier regime that imposed cess, over and above the 28 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on ad-valorem basis.  As per a finance ministry notification dated March 31, the GST cess rate that would be applicable on pan masala is 0.32 times the retail sale price (RSP) of the pan masala pouch.  Pan masala, containing tobacco gutkha, now has a cess rate of 0.61 times the RSP, while the rate for smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes is 0.69 times.  Chewing tobacco , filter khaini, and jarda scented tobacco attract a cess of 0.56 times the RSP, and the rate for branded unmanufactured tobacco and hookah or gudaku is 0.36 times the RSP.  The new rates are applicable from April 1, 2023. Moving to RSP-based levy would mean that manufacturers would now have to pay the cess on the final retail price of masala and chewing tobacco at the time it crosses the factory gate.  This would help curb tax evasion as the cess would be collected at the first point itself.  AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said moving to an RSP-based system can provide a more stable source of revenue for the government in case of broken supply chains.  \"In the new taxation scheme, the entire cess is collected at the first point of sale, i.e., the manufacturer itself, limiting the impact of tax evasion in the sector,\" Mohan said.  The estimated revenue from RSP-based cess rate on pan masala and tobacco is almost at the same level as was in the earlier ad- valorem regime.  However, in the earlier regime since there were instances of tax evasion, the revenue collection was lower. The government last month amended the GST law and capped the maximum rate of GST compensation cess that would be levied on pan masala, cigarettes and other forms of tobacco, linking it to the RSP of the product.  The maximum GST compensation cess rate for pan masala will be 51 per cent of the RSP per unit. Till March 31, the cess was charged at a maximum rate of 135 per cent ad-valorem.  The maximum rate for tobacco has been fixed at Rs 4,170 per thousand sticks plus 290 per cent ad-valorem or 100 per cent of the retail sale price per unit.  Till March 31, the highest rate was Rs 4,170 per thousand sticks plus 290 per cent ad-valorem.  In February, the GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister and comprising state counterparts, had approved the report of a panel of state finance ministers on plugging tax evasion in pan masala and gutkha businesses.  The GoM had recommended that the mechanism for levy of compensation cess on pan masala and chewing tobacco be changed from ad-valorem to a specific rate-based levy to boost the first stage collection of the revenue.', \"India's tiger population in 2022 stood at 3,167, highlighted the latest tiger census data released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday. The tiger population stood at 1,411 in 2006, 1,706 in 2010, 2,226 in 2014, 2,967 in 2018 and 3,167 in 2022, the data shared by the PM showed.At the inaugural session of commemoration of 50 years of 'Project Tiger', the Prime Minister also launched the 'International Big Cat Alliance', which will focus on protection and conservation of seven major big cats of the world, including tiger and lion. He also released a booklet 'Amrit Kaal Ka Tiger Vision', presenting the vision for tiger conservation in the next 25 years.(With inputs from PTI)\", 'To celebrate romance or toast a great performance, pop open the Champagne, of course. That’s why the 95th Academy Awards featured Brad Pitt’s pink bubbly Fleur de Miraval. But today, along with their sex appeal, the finest bottles also pour out heady investment returns. And as the market bubbled ever higher in 2021 and 2022, speculators pounced.Here are the kinds of numbers that stirred them up: From January to September 2022, a case of all-Chardonnay 2012 Salon Le Mesnil soared 232%, from £3,800 to £12,600 ($4,670 to $15,485), according to Liv-Ex, the London International Vintners Exchange. The Liv-Ex Champagne 50 Index, which tracks the price performance for recent vintages of a dozen top brands, was a runaway star, outperforming gold, the FTSE, and the S&P 500, as well as the Bordeaux First Growths and even Burgundy.Keep in mind that a decade ago the world’s finest bubbly accounted for a mere 2% of secondary market trades on Liv-Ex. That share climbed to make it the third most-traded region behind Bordeaux and Burgundy (at 18.7%) in Nov. 2022, and remained in third position until US wines spiked during the week of March 17-23.When prices started cooling late last November and trended downward in early 2023, my big question was: Is Champagne’s bull run over?No, insists Tom Gearing, chief executive officer of Cult Wines, a UK-based fine wine investment company. He’s positive but cautious about the Champagne market for 2023, citing continued strong global demand, as well as the region’s serious brand power and wide distribution. Vintage bottlings offer rarity, exclusivity, aging potential and a good track record during economic downturns. Lower production in 2021 and 2022 tightened supply, with some top houses running out last fall.And prices remain high at auction, as Charles Curtis, founder of wine advisory service WineAlpha and author of Vintage Champagne: 1899–2019, reminded me at lunch over glasses of Burgundy’s great Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Several of Curtis’s clients bid the high estimates listed in recent auction catalogues and still lost out because the bottles sold for much more.Jamie Ritchie, worldwide chairman of wine and spirits for Sotheby’s, says interest in Champagne has been escalating over the past decade, including in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. The amount of Champagne lots in their sales, he says, is growing big-time. Its “Ethereal Cellar” auction in Hong Kong on April 2 will include 82 lots of rare Krug vintages and 60 of Dom Perignon. White Plains, New York-based Zachys’ March auction featured 156 lots of champagne.This kind of auction fever wasn’t always so.According to Liv-Ex’s Robbie Stevens, broad interest in Champagne investing started a few years ago when buyers began to realize how undervalued great examples were compared with the best Bordeaux and Burgundy. “One catalyst was the release of the extraordinary 2008 vintage,” he says, “and then the slew of great vintages that have followed—2012, 2013 and 2014.” Investors got excited, then looked back to stock up on earlier vintages.Another driver of demand may be anxiety over how global warming will affect the quality and style of future vintages. In other words, better buy now, just in case.Gearing adds in yet another reason to have faith in Champagne’s continued investment potential: It remains an icon of luxury in a world where there’s been an explosion of wealth. Despite Covid, the war in Ukraine, inflation and looming recession, luxury goods boomed last year and the 2022 edition of the Bain & Company-Altagamma Luxury study predicted even further growth in 2023.What to invest inMost Champagnes are blends of wine from several vintages, but for the best ROI go for more limited vintage Champagnes. Produced only in the best years, they’re aged longer before release, and prices consistently go up with age. After all, supply dwindles as drinkers celebrate.It used to be that only a handful of famous grands marques, such as Louis Roederer Cristal and Dom Perignon, were investment-grade brands. Now the pool has widened to include grower champagnes with high-profile reputations. (These are made by small estates who grow their own grapes.) The cult label Jacques Selosse, for example, is smoking. The cost of the 2008 has more than doubled since it was released only a few years ago.While Curtis still advises his clients to focus on major grands marques like Krug, Cult Wines includes both categories in its portfolio. Gearing says prices for super-premium names such as Salon could be levelling out. He sees increasing interest in better-value grands marques such as Rare Brut (see below) and in the undervalued but excellent 2006 vintage (15% to 40% cheaper than the stunning 2008), as well as “an upward trajectory” for grower labels that have “phenomenal quality and brand momentum.” Cult Wines’ best performer among grower picks last year was 2012 Cedric Bouchard Les Ursules Blanc de Noir, up 332% over the past five years.Rosé Champagne, which is rarer than white cuvées, commands a premium. Liv-Ex reports that prices for examples from the superlative 2008 vintage on average are 96% higher for the six most-traded houses. Rarity also drives higher prices for extra-large formats like jeroboams and methuselahs.Not surprisingly, companies such as Francois Pinault’s Artemis Group, owners of Bordeaux first growth Chateau Latour, have started investing in the region. In 2022, Artemis acquired Jacquesson. Expect it to gain more visibility and prominence in the future.Based on recommendations from Cult Wines, Charles Curtis and Vinovest, here are eight Champagnes to consider buying. As you can see by my tasting notes, none will disappoint.Blue-Chip Champagnes2008 Dom Perignon ($375)This pick may seem too obvious, but there’s always demand for a top vintage of the most famous luxury fizz brand in the world. That’s especially true in Asia, where interest in Champagne is growing. Japan is already on-trend. This is a brilliant wine, ripe and racy. Agencies2008 Dom Perignon2006 Krug Vintage Brut ($400)A super classic, beloved by connoisseurs for its rich, toasty elegance. Over the past five years the price of 2006 has climbed 57% yet still costs half the price of the only slightly better rated 2008. Agencies2006 Krug Vintage Brut2012 Louis Roederer Cristal ($345)Citrusy pure Cristal usually appreciates quickly, which is why demand is consistently high. This price of this vintage, the first one to be certified biodynamic, increased 80.1% from April 2021 to Feb. 2023. Agencies2012 Louis Roederer Cristal2008 Vintage Rare Brut Millesime ($175)This well-priced, less well-known fizz has extreme rarity on its side: It debuted in 1976 and only 12 vintages have been made. Prices of older vintages have been climbing. Agencies2008 Vintage Rare Brut MillesimeGrower Champagnes2017 Cédric Bouchard Roses de Jeanne Les Ursules Blanc de Noirs ($320)A star in the grower world, Bouchard makes single vineyard, single variety, single vintage, zero dosage champagnes in tiny quantities. This classic cuvée has a following. The brand was one of the top 10 performers for Cult Wines last year.2013 Egly-Ouriet Grand Cru Millesime Brut ($800)A rising investment star among grower Champagnes, its 2009 increased 257% in value in 2022. This recent vintage is supremely elegant. Agencies2017 Cédric Bouchard Roses de Jeanne Les Ursules Blanc de Noirs | 2013 Egly-Ouriet Grand Cru Millesime Brut2016 Dhondt-Grellet Le Bateau Vieilles Vignes Extra Brut ($250)This grower is gaining traction for phenomenal quality, says Gearing, and its dazzling wines still offer “stellar relative value.” Agencies2016 Dhondt-Grellet Le Bateau Vieilles Vignes Extra Brut2009 Jacques Selosse Grand Cru Extra Brut Millesime ($1,800)Micro-production (4,000 cases a vintage), high quality and a cult reputation have propelled this brand into the region’s elite. It had the best average price performance on Liv-Ex last year and is No. 11 on the Power 100 list. The 2006 is the cheapest recent vintage on the market.

Around 700-800 candidates have received such mails,” said Harpreet Saluja, president of NITES. The mails were sent to mainly freshers who were offered jobs by erstwhile Mindtree. The merger of LTI and Mindtree came into effect in November last year.In response to ET’s request for a comment, the company said it is in the silent period ahead of earnings announcement on April 27 and hence will not be commenting on the matter.ET has reviewed a copy of the email sent by LTIMindtree.The company had sent offer letters to these freshers for training and employment in January 2022. However, instead of providing them with an onboarding date, the company has now introduced a learning and training programme with a duration of 6-7 weeks, the union said.

Also, under a proctored assessment framework, the milestone-based assessments score will be multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with 40% weightage and coding assignments will have 60% weightage. Two attempts will be given to clear each milestone assessment, the mail added.“Students with 60% or above in all three milestones will be considered to be successful in the IGNITE programme and will be considered for onboarding in batches based on business demand,” it added.The Mumbai-headquartered firm has also instructed the freshers to accept the option by next week otherwise a “No” or not giving a response will mean the offer of training and subsequent employment earlier made to you will stand auto cancelled.This comes as some engineering graduates of batches 2022 and even 2021 are yet to be onboarded by IT services companies, which are marred by a demand slowdown. Labour unions told ET earlier that the numbers could be in thousands and the issue is more acute in certain companies. Some candidates have taken to Twitter to highlight their woes. Most companies, however, said all the offers made to campus hires will be honoured.ET had also earlier reported that the tapering of post-pandemic demand surge and also the cooling off of attrition metric at Indian IT firms are resulting in fewer campus offers at colleges for 2023 batch graduates. It is up to 30% lower in certain colleges.', \"Easter this year coincides with the Chinese Year of the Rabbit. Which makes it a good time to consider our curious relationship with these small mammals. We celebrate them with chocolate bunnies and extol, as the Chinese do, their survival skills, despite their apparent vulnerability. Yet, humans have been the biggest threat to their survival — even if, occasionally, the rabbits have turned the tables.Rabbits flourish best in temperate zones, which is why we aren’t too familiar with them in India. Our equivalent is the hare, which is solitary, and doesn’t form the large, fairly visible rabbit colonies that Europeans could observe.This led the Europeans first to hunt and then domesticate rabbits. Cuniculture, as rabbit rearing is called, required large pens lined with stone to prevent rabbits digging themselves free.A simpler model was to leave them semi-wild, but kill other predators, like foxes and weasels. Other than that, little effort was needed, since rabbits foraged local vegetation, survived harsh winters thanks to their thick coats (which could also be used after they were killed) and being underground.Their link with Easter probably came because the festival heralded Europe’s spring, when they came above ground to feed hungrily, making them easy to kill. Lent also brought a particular demand for rabbit foetuses which some religious authorities deemed were not meat but fish, since they were still ‘swimming’ in their mother’s bodies, and hence could be eaten during Lenten meatless fasts.As Europeans sailed the world, they took rabbits with them, releasing them on islands along the way, to provide easy meat for future sailors. However, the environmental costs of this were huge, as rabbits decimated native vegetation and the animals that depended on it.“Rabbits introduced onto Laysan Island near Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, in 1903, had by 1936 caused the elimination of three endemic bird species and 22 of the 26 plant species,” writes Brian Coman in his book 'Tooth & Nail'. iStockThis is where rabbits turned the tables. Coman’s book is about what happened when they reached Australia, a place that was perfect for them. Settlers were clearing native forests anyway, to create grasslands for sheep — which was ideal for rabbits. With few natural predators, rabbit numbers exploded. They ate the grass meant for sheep and undermined the land with their burrows. Australia was in danger of being over-run by rabbits.Coman details how Australians fought back, with rabbit hunts and introduction of European predators and poisons, which both worked very well to eliminate native animals, but hardly stopped the rabbits. Over 320,000 kms of fences were erected, enough to circle the Earth eight times. Nothing really seemed to work until viruses like myxomatosis were discovered, which killed them en masse, in vast disturbing scenes of dying rabbits. Yet, eventually, rabbits developed some resistance, and their threat persists.Despite this long history of exploitation, or because of it, humans have also found it strangely easy to empathise with rabbits. Perhaps because, like us, they live in large groups, or because their fluffy, big-eyed cuteness makes it easier to anthropomorphise than chickens or cattle, but it is common to create stories in which rabbits act like humans. American slaves, for example, created the character of Brer Rabbit, who was oppressed like them, but found ways to survive.From Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit to Bugs Bunny and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, we have created appealing rabbit characters who have steadily made it harder to eat real rabbits. Today, cuniculture is often proposed as an easy form of livestock farming, yet never really takes off — which shows, perhaps, the real triumph of rabbits.The one dish the British left Indians with is that club favourite of Welsh Rabbit or Rarebit, a culinary joke since it has no rabbit in it. This delicious dish of molten cheese with beer or bechamel sauce on toast is really all the rabbit we need.\", 'Metaverse is here. At least in some form. Companies like Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia all have plans for the metaverse and while it hasn’t really made enough inroads to reach the end consumer, there’s enough curiosity. But what exactly is needed to ‘enter’ the metaverse?ONE HEADSET TO RULE ’EM ALLStarting with the obvious but one will certainly need to have a good internet connection. Once you have that, to do almost anything — to really be a part of it — one will need a headset. Metaverse is all about an immersive, digital world and to experience that you need a VR headset.Now, here also there are a couple of options. For instance, there’s the Oculus Quest series of headsets from Facebook. These headsets — priced around $300 — are a do-it-all kind of device. In other words, users don’t need a PC or a console to use it.On the other hand, there are other VR headsets from the likes of Sony, HP and Valve, which need a PC or a Playstation to give the best experience. Do keep in mind that there are certain elements of the metaverse which don’t really need a headset. For example, Roblox, which is a popular game that gives users the chance to be a part of the virtual world, doesn’t need any headset for playing the game.A DIGITAL CURRENCYMetaverse platforms are expected to have a digital currency. After all, if you want to purchase digital assets or goods, then you do need moolah. Digital currencies would also be an integral part of truly experiencing the metaverse.HAPTIC GLOVESWhen Meta showcased a prototype of haptic gloves, it looked like straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie. The prototype showed how using them users could touch and feel VR objects. However, it’s a bit difficult to — at least currently — imagine a future where people will be wearing haptic gloves. Headset? Perhaps. Gloves? Unlikely, at least in the short term.', 'The road transport and highways sector has the maximum number of delayed projects at 407, followed by railways at 114 and the petroleum industry at 86, showed a government report. In the road transport and highways sector, 407 out of 717 projects are delayed. For railways, out of 173 projects, 114 are delayed, while in the petroleum sector, 86 out of 146 projects are running behind schedule, as per the latest flash report on infrastructure projects for February 2023. The Infrastructure and Project Monitoring Division (IPMD) is mandated to monitor central sector infrastructure projects costing Rs 150 crore and above based on the information provided on the Online Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) by the project implementing agencies. The IPMD comes under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The report showed that the Muneerabad-Mahaboobnagar rail project is the most delayed. It is delayed by 276 months. The second-most delayed project is the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail project, which is delayed by 247 months. The third-most delayed project, Belapur-Seawood-Urban Electrified Double Line, is running 228 months behind schedule. The Flash Report for February 2023 contains information on the status of the 1,418 Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs 150 crore and above. As many as 823 projects are delayed, 346 projects reported cost overrun and 242 projects reported both times and cost overrun with respect to their original project implementation schedules. A total of 823 projects are delayed with respect to their original schedules and 159 projects have reported additional delays vis-a-vis their date of completion reported in the previous month. Of these 159 projects, 38 are mega projects costing Rs 1,000 crore and above. About the road transport and highways sector, the report stated that the total original cost of implementation of 717 projects, when sanctioned, was Rs 3,97,255.47 crore but this was subsequently estimated to be Rs 4,14,400.44 crore, implying a cost overrun of 4.3 per cent. The expenditure incurred on these projects till February 2023 is Rs 2,33,007.06 crore, which is 56.2 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects. Similarly, in railways, the total original cost of implementation of 173 projects, when sanctioned, was Rs 37,2761.45 crore but this was subsequently anticipated to be Rs 6,26,632.52 crore, implying a cost overrun of 68.1 per cent. The expenditure incurred on these projects till February 2023 is Rs 3,79,380.95 crore, which is 60.5 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects. About the petroleum sector, it said, the total original cost of implementation of 146 projects, when sanctioned, was Rs 3,67,615.67 crore but this was subsequently anticipated to be Rs 3,85,117.08 crore, implying a cost overrun of 4.8 per cent. The expenditure incurred on these projects till February 2023 is Rs 1,44,162.3 crore, which is 37.4 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.', 'India\\'s coal imports increased by 32 per cent to 148.58 million tonne (MT) in April-February FY23 against 112.38 MT in the year-ago period, according to a report. The import of coking coal rose 7.69 per cent to 50.50 MT during April-February FY23 compared to 46.89 MT a year ago, mjunction said in its latest report. In February 2023 alone, the non-coking coal import stood at 11.68 MT against 9.42 MT in the same month last year. Coking coal imports were 4.40 MT against 4.03 MT imported in February 2022. India is among the top five coal-producing countries in the world. However, some parts of its coal requirement are met through imports as the country is also among the major consumers of the dry fuel. For coking coal - a key raw material used in steel making - the country remains heavily dependent on imports.

But last September he found a new creative outlet, one that led him to deceive thousands of people: the artificial intelligence program Midjourney, which generates wild and wonderful images from brief text instructions. \"Soon after starting with Midjourney, I became obsessed with the creative possibilities,\" Avery told AFP. Midjourney and rivals like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion generate unique pictures by mashing up a vast back catalogue of images they have been \"trained\" on. For Avery, a 48-year-old software engineer and lawyer by training from Virginia in the United States, Midjourney was liberating. He said it allowed him to create beautiful art without needing to tackle his own social anxieties. \"Then I started to wonder if I could make AI images that could pass for photographs,\" he said.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories This led to his fateful experiment: He started an Instagram account to house his Midjourney output, without being entirely upfront about the origins of the images.\\'Misleading\\'\"At the beginning, I don\\'t think many people thought the images were photographs,\" he said. \"The eyes and skin were unrealistic.\" He fixed these glitches with a dose of Adobe Photoshop, eventually populating his Instagram feed with stunning and stark portraits of beautiful - but unreal - people. More users flocked to his feed, and more of them began to think the images were genuine. \"People would ask in the comments about my camera and lens equipment,\" he said.  \"I\\'d respond with the equipment I actually use for real photos or equipment I had included as part of the prompt.\" He admits his answers were \"misleading\" since they suggested he had used his gear to create those specific images. Yet he just got deeper into the deception, spending hours choosing and editing images to boost the realism and deleting earlier efforts that were more obviously AI-generated. His follower count was rising rapidly, so the experiment was a success. But he was struggling to maintain the facade.Losing sleep\"It grew far beyond my expectations,\" Avery said. \"The followers and my misleading answers made me feel uneasy, and I had trouble sleeping at night.\" He eventually told the specialist website Ars Technica what he had done, added a mention of AI to his Instagram biography and started to give honest answers to his followers. \"I\\'ve slept a lot better since then,\" he said. Although he did get some abuse - \"I had to block about 30 people\" - he said the reaction overall was positive, and his Instagram account, now with almost 40,000 followers, is still growing.  These days he populates it with both real photography and clearly labelled images generated from Midjourney. He said the AI tool has been hugely beneficial, helping him discover a love for portrait photography. But the downside is that once again he isn\\'t sleeping so well - he stays up all night creating images on Midjourney.', 'There is something ironic, almost poignant, about Europe’s furious response to the Biden administration’s flagship climate law. For the past six or seven years, European officials have spoken regularly about how a climate-friendly economy was the future. “I am convinced that the old growth model that is based on fossil fuels and pollution is out of date,” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, declared in 2019. It was time to embrace a “new growth strategy,” she said, one as much about “cutting emissions” as “about creating jobs and boosting innovation.”That’s exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act is designed to do. But since President Biden signed it into law last August, European leaders have called it a “super aggressive” protectionist affront to global cooperation on climate change. The law invests at least $370 billion to conjure new American industries in hydrogen, solar panels and zero-carbon aviation fuels. And one of its most important subsidies — a tax credit of up to $7,500 for electric vehicles — can be applied only to E.V.s assembled on this continent with mostly American-made batteries using minerals from the United States or one of its free-trade partners.That kind of protectionism is the opposite of how experts have historically imagined the battle against climate change. Even calling it a battle reflects our hope that climate change will require a final showdown in which all of humanity clasps hands and annihilates fossil fuel use forever. But there’s now reason to think that certain kinds of competition — not cooperation — might be inherent to solving the climate problem itself: that all else being equal, fighting climate change might lead to more protectionism, more economic tension, more trade wars.For nearly half a century, scholars have grasped that a stable, habitable climate is a public commons — perhaps the biggest, gnarliest, most important commons that humanity has ever had to manage. At the same time, however, economists saw that fossil fuel consumption — and thus carbon emissions — have strongly correlated with economic growth. So countries in climate negotiations had to make a terrible choice: They could “cooperate,” and work with their neighbours to lower emissions; or they could free-ride on their neighbours’ emissions cuts to opportunistically grow their economies.In other words, solving climate change was a prisoner’s dilemma, where each country had individual incentives that worked against the world’s. Scholars, including William Nordhaus, the Nobel-Prize-winning Yale economist, spent a tremendous amount of time trying to finesse the free-riding problem. Outside of an international agreement, the problem seemed intractable.But about a decade ago, something began to change. Rich countries grew their economies, but saw their emissions fall. China, which emits more climate pollution than any other country, reaped enormous economic and strategic benefits from its booming green-technology industries. And the world began to understand that climate action was not in fact a trade-off — cutting emissions does not mean giving up on growth. In fact, low-carbon technologies, especially batteries and renewables, are the future of the economy; they can generate energy more cheaply and support human flourishing at lower cost than the fossil fuels and combustion engines that they replace.In 2020, the political scientists Michaël Aklin and Matto Mildenberger showed that based on the historical evidence, countries haven’t backed off on their climate commitments when their neighbours have. Instead, what dictates climate policy is political competition within countries — domestic coalitions vying for power over society and the economy. Climate policy generates “new economic winners and losers,” Aklin and Mildenberger wrote, and countries pass more of it only when the winners have the upper hand.You can see this now as America and Europe fuss over their respective climate policies, and exactly how profits and future growth should be divided among manufacturers, fossil-fuel companies, workers and consumers. Meanwhile, executives, activists, lobbyists and officials have their own ideas about how the economy should be run , and these, too, shape the outcome.Last year, Jonas Nahm at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, observed that countries with export and manufacturing-oriented economies, such as Germany, adopted national climate policies before import-dependent countries did. Manufacturers and their political allies saw the opportunity in green technology and pushed politicians to seize it, he reasoned.But these dynamics aren’t limited to exporting countries. The Inflation Reduction Act will help boost manufacturing the United States because our industries are after the same opportunity, and politicians are hoping to create a base of popular support to drive down even more pollution in the future.And here’s the rub: Once every country wants a slice of an industry, trade conflict is likely to follow.That’s because clean energy is a growing and highly strategic industry, and trade conflict always arises from these very industries, Maureen Hinman, co-founder and executive chair of Silverado Policy accelerator and a former director at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, told me. Civil aviation is a growing and strategic industry, and the United States and the European Union have been at loggerheads over Boeing and Airbus for years. Both the United States and the European Union want a chunk of the global aviation market.This means that managing trade disputes isn’t some sideshow to the real work of fighting climate change. It is fighting climate change. Once you accept that, a few more ideas snap into place.First, countries like the United States, Japan and those in the European Union need to calm down about the existence of climate-related trade spats. They’re here. They’re not going away. Second, officials and experts should pay close attention to worst-case scenarios. One might be that Western companies simply never get their act together. They devolve into infighting, and China continues to dominate the new-energy supply chain, essentially making the entire world dependent on a sole — and very politically fraught — supplier.But another scenario might be that the United States, Europe, East Asia and China each builds its own domestic supply chain for zero-carbon technologies, and that none of these chains achieves sufficient scale to bring down long-term costs. Officials should pay particular attention to industries where trade competition could make climate change worse. Hydrogen is maybe the biggest example: Although it could potentially eliminate emissions from many industries, it’s also a leak-prone pollutant in its own right. If Europe and the United States get into a “race to the bottom” around hydrogen subsidies, supporting ever leakier and less stringent supply chains in a bid to dominate the industry, then the planet will suffer. We do not have much room for error.Finally, we all must attend to the one truly catastrophic possibility of this new era of climate competition. The more that the United States and China see each other as enemies, the more that they sever their trade ties, the closer we get to the worst-possible outcome for humanity and the biosphere: a new world war. But if we are careful, decarbonisation can be a solvent of sorts, dissolving the strife into a contest of mutual advantage. That will require a healthy vigilance and not a small amount of luck.', 'From appointing a Sikh to its top body parliamentary board, to having four muslim MLCs under its rule in Uttar Pradesh and in between celebrating Christmas in Kerala, the BJP being a ruling dispensation has expanded its outreach to minorities more for perception then electoral benefits. After celebrating Easter with Christians in Kerala this month, the BJP appointed Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor as member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, taking total strength of its muslims MLCs to four highest among all political parties in the state.In August last year, the BJP had appointed its relatively new leader Iqbal Singh Lalpura to its top decision making body parliamentary board.In the last two national executives of BJP, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been meeting spiritual leaders of minorities, asked party workers to reach out to minorities looking beyond electoral purposes.However, the BJP has just one Muslim MP and not a single Union Minister from the community. Elaborating the purpose of BJP\\'s outreach activities, the party\\'s minority morcha Jamal Siddiqui said,\"the opposition especially Congress always tried to create a perception about us as a divisive force, whereas the BJP under Modi is inclusive force working on the principle of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas.\"He further said the party has taken various steps of giving representation to minorities within the organisation as a step towards showing it as an inclusive party.Besides politics, BJP being a ruling dispensation has to take steps to counter opposition-created perception about it for overall governance good and present its inclusivity character to the political spectrum across the globe, a senior party leader said.Besides outreach BJP leaders are also banking on defections of Congress\\' Sikh and Christians leaders from Punjab and Kerala respectively, to make inroads in these the two states where Congress won majority of the Lok Sabha seats, the party functionaries told ET. In the 2019 general elections, the Congress won 23 Lok Sabha seats in these two states on its own, 15 out of 20 in Kerala and 8 out of 13 seats in Punjab.', 'New Delhi: Banks and financial institutions have sanctioned ₹23.2 lakh crore to about 408.2 million beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), which was launched eight years ago.\"Growth of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) has contributed massively to the Make in India programme, as strong domestic MSMEs lead to increased indigenous production both for domestic markets as well as for exports,\" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday.She said PMMY has helped generate large-scale employment opportunities at the grassroots level and proved to be a game changer in boosting the Indian economy. PMMY was launched on April 8, 2015, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to facilitate easy collateral-free microcredit of up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small and micro-entrepreneurs for income-generating activities. Loans under the scheme are provided by member lending institutions - banks, non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions and other financial intermediaries - the finance ministry said in a statement on Saturday.\"Since the launch of the scheme, as of March 24, 2023, about ₹23.2 lakh crore has been sanctioned in 40.82 crore loan accounts,\" Sitharaman said on the eighth anniversary of the scheme. About 68% of accounts under the scheme belong to women entrepreneurs, the minister said.  Easier Credit for Micro-enterprises | page 7 About 51% of accounts belong to entrepreneurs from scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, the finance minister said. This demonstrates that easy availability of credit to budding entrepreneurs has led to innovation and sustained increase in per capita income, said Sitharaman.Minister of state for finance Bhagwat K Karad said PMMY aims to provide collateral-free access to credit in a seamless manner to micro-enterprises. \"It has brought the unserved and under-served sections of the society within the framework of institutional credit,\" he said. The government policy of promoting the scheme has led millions of MSME enterprises in the formal economy and has helped them escape the clutches of moneylenders offering very high-cost funds, said Karad. Implementation of the financial inclusion programme is based on three pillars - banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured and funding the unfunded. The scheme was launched to encourage small businesses and banks were asked to provide collateral-free loans up to ₹10 lakh under three categories - Shishu (up to ₹50,000), Kishore (between ₹50,000 and ₹5 lakh) and Tarun (₹10 lakh). Shishu accounts for 83% of the total loans, followed by Kishore (15%) and Tarun (2%).Targets have been achieved since inception of the scheme, except during 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the statement said.', 'The US job market moderated somewhat but still showed remarkable resilience even as other parts of the economy slowed, and OPEC+ announced a surprise cut in oil production.A 236,000 increase in March payrolls followed stronger advances in the prior two months, and the US unemployment rate dropped near record lows. At the same time, annual wages rose at the slowest pace since June 2021.While more tempered pay growth should help aid the Federal Reserve in its inflation fight, developments outside of the control of the US central bank, as well as its global counterparts, risk keeping price pressures elevated. OPEC+ members earlier in the week shocked markets with their announcement to reduce crude oil output in a bid to shore up prices.Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy:USBloombergUS payrolls rose at a firm pace last month with the unemployment rate dropping again near record lows, paving the way for the Fed to increase interest rates at its next meeting. The figures suggest that supply and demand of workers are coming more into balance, which, if sustained, could help moderate wage gains further.BloombergApplications for unemployment benefits last week signaled that the labor market still remains relatively strong, even though data revisions indicate some emerging signs of softening. Initial unemployment claims were 228,000 in the latest week. The government also revised up previous weeks’ numbers. BloombergThe economies in nearly half of US states barely grew or even shrank since the pandemic, underscoring the unevenness of the nation’s recovery. Gross domestic product was lower in 2022 in eight states including Louisiana and Hawaii that are dependent on tourism, migration shifts during the pandemic brought hundreds of thousands more people to Florida and Texas — which experienced the second- and third-largest economic growth, respectively.WorldBloombergCentral bankers who spent past weeks puzzling over how financial turmoil will impact their outlook now have a jolt in the form of higher oil prices to consider. The production cut announced by OPEC+ and the danger of another surge in crude costs complicates the debate in Frankfurt, London and Washington about where inflation is headed and how much further interest rates should rise to control it. BloombergIsrael’s central bank moderated the pace of its monetary tightening, acknowledging the potential risks to monetary policy from the government’s judicial plan. Sri Lanka held rates steady after securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund, while Australia, Romania, Chile, Poland and India also left borrowing costs unchanged.BloombergThe US Treasury Department released its much-awaited guidance to clarify who can benefit from electric vehicle tax subsidies. Consumers can claim as much as $7,500 in federal tax credits if they buy a clean-energy vehicle that satisfies certain US rules regarding critical minerals and battery components. The rules are broadly aimed at diluting China’s market power over raw materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel and magnesium, which are key ingredients for electric motors and batteries.AsiaBloombergChina’s manufacturing activity unexpectedly eased in March, a private survey showed, leading a slide in factory gauges across Asia as the global economic outlook darkened. BloombergJapan is poised to sharply raise its chip-gear spending in an attempt to boost its position in the global semiconductor market, as it tightens exports amid a US-led push to limit China’s tech ambitions. Japan is expected to spend $7 billion on fab equipment next year, which would mark a 82% jump from this year — the largest in the world — according to data from SEMI, a global association of chipmaking equipment producers.EuropeBloombergEurope’s battle with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation is far from over, and food is the latest focal point. Even as headline inflation starts to ease, the upward pressure on food prices remains firmly in place. That means a large chunk of household spending, the weekly supermarket trip, is rapidly getting more and more expensive.Emerging MarketsBloombergLatin America and the Caribbean will experience only modest growth this year as the region’s economies suffer from high interest rates and falling commodity prices, the World Bank said in a report released Tuesday. The Washington-based organization projects that the regional economy as a whole will expand 1.4% through December, lagging all other regions. BloombergArgentina is bringing back a temporary exchange rate for soy exports in an elaborate bid to prop up the central bank’s dwindling cash reserves and ease the economic pain of a historic drought. It adds to the economy minister’s complex strategy to blunt the effects of a looming recession this year with inflation charging over 100%.--With assistance from Philip Aldrick, Bryce Baschuk, Maria Eloisa Capurro, Agnieszka de Sousa, Ignacio Olivera Doll, Patrick Gillespie, Mackenzie Hawkins, Michelle Jamrisko, Sam Kim, Alessandra Migliaccio, Augusta Saraiva, Zoe Schneeweiss, Craig Stirling and Alex Tanzi. ', 'If you saw a Facebook ad recently for Jeremy\\'s Razors, which bills itself as a \"woke-free\" razor for men, you may well be a father of school-age children who likes Ultimate Fighting, Hershey\\'s chocolate, hunting or Johnny Cash. This is according to Facebook\\'s ad library, which describes the audiences to whom marketers target their advertisements.I can see why Jeremy\\'s Razors is focusing its ad dollars on men who might appreciate its hypermasculine message. But the reverse is not as clear: Are these men better off for having been pitched an \"anti-woke\" razor?In the traditional media world, ads are sold in context of the area in which publications are sold: Perhaps Jeremy\\'s Razors might favor advertising in Deer & Deer Hunting magazine, for example. But online, ads are sold based on the many details advertisers have gleaned about your behavior and interests based on your online activity. Tech firms track nearly every click from website to website, developing detailed profiles of your interests and desires, and make that data available to advertisers. That\\'s why you get those creepy ads in your Instagram feed or on websites that seem to know what you were just talking about.The ability to track people has turned out to be an unbeatable advantage for the online ad industry, which has grown to a $540 billion market worldwide.  Calls to Reform Surveillance Business Model  The online ad industry has dwarfed all other forms of advertising, including TV, radio and newspapers, according to the media agency GroupM. It has propelled the massive growth of Google and Facebook as well as hundreds of so-called \"adtech\" firms that serve as intermediaries between the buyers and sellers of targeting information. But the rise of microtargeting has come with a staggering price tag. \"There is limited evidence to suggest that the efficiency and efficacy gains to advertisers and publishers of this system outweigh the societal impact,\" concludes a 274-page study published by the European Commission earlier this year. It calls for reforming the surveillance business model.Already, we know that web tracking has decimated publishers. This has been particularly devastating for traditional news outlets: Global newspaper revenue plummeted from $107 billion in 2000 to nearly $32 billion in 2022, according to GroupM. This is a blow for democracy: Studies show that voting decreases and corruption increases in communities without strong news outlets. Microtargeting has also enabled advertisers to discriminate in ways that are hard for regulators to catch. It is illegal, for example, for advertisers to use language in their ads suggesting that jobs, housing or credit opportunities are being offered to people of a certain race, gender, age or other protected characteristics. Facebook has repeatedly been shown to have enabled discriminatory advertising. Microtargeting also allows politicians to deliver divisive messages directly to niche groups. Last year, researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Virginia Tech presented a study of the consumer welfare implications of targeted ads. The new study, published online this week, confirmed the results: The targeted ads shown to another set of nearly 500 participants were pitching more expensive products from lower-quality vendors than identical products that showed up in a simple Web search. The products shown in targeted ads were, on average, roughly 10% more expensive than what users could find by searching online.', 'In view of the rise in number of Covid-19 cases across the state, the Uttar Pradesh government has issued a \\'high-priority\\' directive, instructing officials concerned to ensure that international passengers are screened at all airports.The use of mask is now mandatory for all people at crowded places.As per an order issued by the state government, all samples which test positive for Covid should mandatorily be sent for genome sequencing.\"Private and government labs should send all positive Covid samples to the microbiology department at King George\\'s Medical University (KGMU) for whole genome sequencing,\" said the directive.The guideline issued by state secretary was sent to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates, chief medical officers, and other health officials across the state.

NCP leader Ajit Pawar on Saturday hinted that complaints on EVMs were being made by sore losers.\" Whoever loses blames the EVM\\'s, if the EVM\\'s were an issue then how did the AAP come to power in Delhi and Punjab, how did KCR Rao win in Telangana, how did Jagan win in Andhra Pradesh and how did Congress come to power in Rajasthan or Mamata Bannerjee in West Bengal?\" questioned Ajit Pawar.Ajit added, \"Some times people lose elections and they think they could not have lost it and then they start blaming EVMs, however, in reality, the election result is the actual mandate of the people.\"Hours after Ajit Pawar\\'s reaction on the EVM, the Chief Spokesperson of the NCP in Maharashtra Mahesh Tapase issued a release referring to the NCP President\\'s Sharad Pawar and other opposition leaders reservations on EVMs.', \"Beats me what all the brouhaha-heehee is all about. It's not as if we learnt everything in Class 12. (My key takeaway was first learning that frogs have a cloacal aperture, and then encountering one attached to a frog in a lab.) Or that if we missed out anything in our last year of school, we'd never get to know about it - ever. Frankly, like awards juries, what is chucked from a syllabus and what goes in tells you more about the boffins putting it together, and less about whether the syllabus is up to scratch. If The Kashmir Files didn't get a sackload of Oscars, it says a lot about the Academy Awards jury's colonial mindset, not about any kamti in Vivek Agnihotri's R&AW talent. So when the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), in its wisdom (sic), decided to 'rationalise' Class 12 textbooks by dropping bits and bobs to lighten 'students' load' as recommended by the National Education Policy, my first reaction 33 years after passing out of school was: 'Where were you guys when I was drowning in my Nelkon & Parker Advanced Level Physics textbook? Why didn't anyone take out the chapter on 'Velocity of Transverse Wave in a String'? Recalling V = kFxlymx has no bearing on making India a $5 trillion economy!' My second reaction was, 'So?' It's not as if not finding any mention of the Mughals will make graffiti like 'Mumtaz Mahal Taj Mahal' disappear. Nor is it like generations, starting this semester, will be denied the knowledge that hydrogen sulfide smells of rotten eggs, a far more useful thing to learn than remembering the mnemonic BHAJI SABJI FOR MAAM-SAAB and then having to remember what the mnemonic stands for - Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb... after which no one barring Irfan Habib remembers the names except for that last B for Bahadur Shah Zafar. But since no one ever has a slanging match in one's RWA WhatsApp group on the efficacy of Kenneth Arrow's impossibility theorem, or whether cadmium oxide should be the Lewis-acid catalyst of choice in hydrolysis, it's history that serves as everyone's football to kick around and sound smart with. Fair enough. By trimming the Mughals out, though, the NCERT's pedagogues may unwittingly cause larger disruption. Here are a few possibilities staring at generations without recourse to Class 12 Mughal history, and presumably no access to other sources of information like ChatGPT, Amar Chitra Katha, Ashutosh Gowariker-directed or Dilip Kumar-Madhubala-Prithviraj Kapoor-starring movies....  Rana Pratap, Guru Hargobind Singh, Chhatrapati Shivaji, and other valiants may find it a tad difficult to be remembered for their valour minus their prime antagonists. Without Akbar, Jahangir and Aurangzeb, Haldighati, Rohilla and Chakan would possibly become locations for potato and pomegranate cold chain units, leaving our heroes much like Real Madrid without Barcelona; Jai, Veeru and Thakur without Gabbar. Humayun's Tomb in Delhi may have to be reimagined - and renamed - with people learning to say, 'Let's meet outside that place with a big dome that looks like that other place in Agra with a big dome. The abuse 'Babur ki aulad' and variations thereof will have to fall into disrepair. 'Those people' being too diffused a gaali, true secularism will descend, calamitously ending much enthusiasm at least among one lot of enthusiastic sectarians with little work and lots of time on their hands. British colonialism will become much tougher to explain without the Mughal 'long tail'. The Battle of Palashi may no longer be viewed as a battle at all, with history describing Robert Clive and his men spending that hot, humid summer of June 23, 1757, picking mangoes and starting the very first round of negotiations for the soon-to-be signed FTA between UK and whoever was the mango grove's owner. In any case, Mughal history, to my mind, features disproportionately - second only to pre-independence history. B-o-r-i-n-g. I mean, centuries from now, would future generations like to find this last decade dulled by only one overpowering Mughlai-type narrative? Drop the Mughals from textbooks, I say. And while we're at it, that grisly chapter on rotation of rigid bodies from physics textbooks too.\", \"Ajinkya Rahane hit the fastest half-century in this Indian Premier League off 19 balls and led Chennai Super Kings to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians on Saturday. In another one-sided game, league-leading Rajasthan Royals handed Delhi Capitals their third straight defeat. Mumbai, Delhi and Sunrisers Hyderabad are all at the bottom of the table without a point. Mumbai rested its big signing Jofra Archer as a precaution after the fast bowler complained of pain in his bowling arm. But it was the batting which disappointed. Despite a bright start, Mumbai lost its way after captain Rohit Sharma was out for 21 and limped to 157-8. Chennai made short work of that in cruising to 159-3 with 11 balls to spare for its second win in three games. Spinners Ravindra Jadeja (3-20) and Mitchell Santner (2-28) derailed Mumbai's innings. Sharma was brilliantly squared up by Tushar Deshpande (2-31), who hit the top of the middle and off stumps. Chennai was without its own key Englishmen in Ben Stokes (sore heel) and Moeen Ali (ill) and didn't miss them. Rahane's 61 off 27 balls included a six and four boundaries in one over. He raced to his half-century with two successive boundaries against legspinner Piyush Chawla within the powerplay. Rahane was finally dismissed when he miscued Chawla and holed out in the deep in the eighth over. Ruturaj Gaikwad finished off the chase with an unbeaten 40. RAJASTHAN THUMPS DELHIRajasthan openers Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal smacked half-centuries to launch them to 199-4 and a win by 57 runs. Buttler blazed 79 off 51 balls and Jaiswal, who began with five boundaries in the first over, made 60 off 31 balls. Delhi was squeezed to 142-9. Trent Boult's double-wicket start in his 3-29 set the tone, and spinners Yuzvendra Chahal (3-27) and Ravichandran Ashwin (2-25) frustrated the middle order. Made to bat first, Jaiswal raised his half-century off 25 balls with his 11th boundary by flicking left-arm spinner Axar Patel to wide long on. Jaiswal was dismissed in the ninth over when he top-edged Mukesh Kumar after a rollicking platform of 98 with Buttler. Buttler hit 11 fours and a six and departed in the penultimate over when Kumar juggled a catch off his own bowling. Shimron Hetmyer added a rapid 39 off 21 balls in the death overs, and the total was too intimidating for Delhi. Boult was on a hat trick after he nicked off Prithvi Shaw and pinned Manish Pandey but Rilee Rossouw survived to make 14. Lalit Yadav (38) and David Warner added 64 runs for the fourth wicket before Delhi lost six wickets for 40 runs. Boult returned and broke the stand by trapping Yadav. Warner labored for 55 balls for his 65 before he was lbw to Chahal in the 19th over. ___ More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\", 'Indian equities in a holiday-shortened week ended Thursday’s session higher as the RBI announced a pause in rate hike. The move lifted domestic equities sentiment, with Nifty ending at 17,599 points. Sectorally, FMCG, IT and consumer durables ended in the red, while all others ended higher. Markets remained closed on Friday on account of Good Friday.Here\\'s how analysts read the market pulse:\"The surprising policy move to pause interest rate hikes has had a convincing effect on bond yields and the stock market. A plausible peaking of the interest rate will have a positive effect on the financial markets, which was reflected in today’s drop in yield and marginal upside of the domestic stock market when the Asian market was negative. However, the trend to continue during the year will depend on a consistent fall in inflation, which is forecasted to stay elevated above the FY24 target. Given the high gap between current and target inflation, the RBI will have to hold the rates high for a long period, limiting the upside,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.“After witnessing a 700 points rally in the last five trading sessions a consolidation is highly likely. Thus, considering the above factors we expect the Nifty to consolidate over the next few trading sesisons and any dip towards the support zone of 17500 – 17430 should be used as an opportunity to create fresh long positions,” Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.That said, here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Monday’s action:US stocks end quiet session higherWall Street stocks finished a quiet session mostly higher on Thursday, concluding a holiday-shortened trading week that has included weakening economic data.Reports earlier in the week showed a softening in the labor market, a contraction in the manufacturing sector and slowing growth in services.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat at 33,485.29.The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 4,105.02, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite index advanced 0.8 percent to 12,087.96.European shares rise as banking gainsEuropean shares rose on Thursday, heading into a long Easter weekend break, as real estate and travel stocks helped outweigh concerns over a U.S. economic slowdown that were triggered by lacklustre data.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.5%, posting its third consecutive weekly gain, with banking stocks among the biggest boosts.After a strong start to the year, European equities remained under selling pressure from last month as the recent banking turmoil kept the risk sentiment fragile, with skittish investors fretting about mixed economic data and a looming recession.Tech View: Positive candleA reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart with minor upper shadow.

One of the rockets landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, CNN reported.So far the IDF has not reported any damage in Israeli territory, CNN reported.It is the latest flare-up after Israel struck Palestinian militant targets in southern Lebanon and Gaza early Friday in response to dozens of rockets fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it had begun striking targets in Syrian territory after the rockets were launched.\"A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck additional targets in Syrian territory, including a military compound of the Fourth Division of the Syrian Armed Forces, military radars systems and artillery posts used by the Syrian Armed Forces,\" the IDF said in a statement early on Sunday local time.The strikes by the fighter jets followed earlier IDF strikes on Syrian territory using a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle or drone), which targeted the launchers thought to have fired the rockets, CNN reported.The IDF said it \"sees the state of Syria responsible for all activities occurring within its territory and will not allow any attempts to violate Israeli sovereignty.\"Syria said it had responded to \"Israeli air attacks in the southern part of the country,\" and claimed to have intercepted \"some Israeli missiles.\"\"Around 5 AM today, the Israeli enemy carried out an air attack with a number of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, targeting some points in the southern region,\" Syrian state media agency SANA quoted a Syrian military source as saying.According to SANA, the military source added that Syrian air defences had \"intercepted the aggressors\\' missiles and shot down some of them.\"Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed the narrow strip of land in 1981. The Golan Heights is considered occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, CNN reported.The rocket launches come amid heightened tensions in the region following Israeli police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.Israeli police raids of the mosque are considered by Muslims as a major provocation.Israeli police raided the mosque twice on Wednesday last week, claiming that \"hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators (had) barricaded themselves\" inside.On Saturday night, the Israeli police again alleged, \"Many youngsters entered the mosque and closed the doors, for no reason.\"Israel\\'s neighbour Jordan warned of \"catastrophic consequences\" if Israeli forces were to storm the mosque again, CNN reported.Should the Israeli police, \"assault worshipers again, in an attempt to empty [the mosque] of worshipers, in preparation for major incursions into the mosque,\" it would, \"push the situation towards more tension and violence, for which everyone will pay the price,\" the Jordanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ambassador Sinan al-Majali, said in a statement late on Saturday local time.\"The Israeli government bears responsibility for the escalation in Jerusalem and in all the occupied Palestinian territories and for the deterioration that will worsen if it does not stop its incursions into the holy al-Aqsa mosque... and its terrorization of worshipers in these blessed days,\" al-Majali said.The warning from Jordan was followed by a statement from the Israeli Foreign Ministry early on Sunday, saying that people who \"barricade themselves inside [the al-Aqsa mosque] are a dangerous mob, radicalized and incited by Hamas and other terror organizations.\"The Israeli Foreign Ministry called on Jordan\\'s Waqf guards, \"to immediately remove from the al-Aqsa Mosque these extremists who are planning to riot (on Sunday) during Muslim prayers on the Temple Mount and the Priestly Blessing at the Western Wall.\"The Waqf is the Jordan-appointed body that manages the al-Aqsa mosque compound, known as the Temple Mount by Jews. ', 'GCMMF, which sells dairy products under the Amul brand, is expecting 20 per cent growth in its revenue this fiscal to around Rs 66,000 crore on rising demand, its MD Jayen Mehta said. Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) registered a turnover of Rs 55,055 crore in 2022-23, up 18.5 per cent from the previous year. In an interview with PTI, the GCMMF MD (in charge) said it had clocked a strong growth in revenue last fiscal, as demand for branded dairy products rose significantly post-COVID. \"We expect the sales momentum to continue across our product portfolio. Demand is shifting from unorganised to organised players,\" he said. Mehta said the federation is also focusing on growing organic food and edible oil businesses, which are currently very small. Asked about milk prices, Mehta said, \"We have no plans to increase rates as of now\". He pointed out that input cost has risen by 15 per cent in the last one year, forcing the cooperative to hike retail prices to some extent last year. GCMMF did not hike prices in 2020 and 2021 because of COVID, he said, adding that rates were raised a few times last year. GCMMF passes on around 80 per cent of retail prices to dairy farmers. Mehta said the GCMMF\\'s milk procurement increased in March and will rise this month as well. \"Farmers are getting good prices. So, milk supply is improving,\" he said, the flush season will also start soon in South India, which will boost supply. Mehta noted that the demand rose sharply in 2022 post-COVID and the trend would continue, although the pace of growth should moderate this year on base effect. He also said the demand-supply situation would remain balanced in near future. GCMMF currently has 98 milk processing plants across the country with an installed capacity of 470 lakh litres per day. It is collecting on an average of 270 lakh litres per day. The federation will expand capacity by 30-40 lakh litres per day in the next two years, the MD said. In the last fiscal, GCMMF reported 21 per cent growth in fresh products, which contributes 50 per cent to its turnover. Ice cream range grew by 41 per cent. \"We have achieved volume sales growth in all product categories. Pouch milk, which is the highest turnover product, has shown volume growth in double digits. Apart from this, our products like butter, ghee, Ice Cream, UHT milk, flavoured milk, paneer, and fresh cream have also shown double-digit growth,\" Mehta had said recently.', 'Will Brown, a Dubai-based global-risk executive who has been traveling to Riyadh for work for almost seven years, has started to notice a change on his two-hour flight to the Saudi capital. Rather than the usual cohort of males who make up the overwhelming demographic of professionals commuting to Saudi Arabia, there are now women and children on board.“The plane isn’t just middle-aged white dudes flying in on a Sunday, you’re starting to see people move with their families,” said Brown, 49, who usually travels to Riyadh for the kingdom’s Sunday-Thursday working week. Brown and his family will soon make the move to Riyadh full time, because his employer Control Risks, a global risk consultancy firm, is setting up its regional headquarters there.The firm wants to comply with recent Saudi rules that restrict state entities from doing business with international companies that do not have their regional HQs in the country by January 2024, even if that may require a step back in terms of quality of life for its staff. The new measures are intended to attract foreign investment and workers. They are part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambition to open the country to international markets, putting the capital among the world’s 10 largest city economies and doubling its population to at least 15 million by 2030 — despite many traditional barriers related to the kingdom’s strict interpretation of Islamic law.The push has not gone unnoticed in Dubai, the Middle East’s main business and tourism hub, which has long been the default option for expatriates.As of end 2022, almost 80 companies have applied for licenses to move their headquarters to Riyadh, Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in a recent interview, adding the city would become “the grand capital of the Middle East, politically and economically.”Question MarksBut the big question is whether Riyadh is ready from an infrastructure, housing, lifestyle and even administrative standpoint for an influx of foreign white-collar workers and their families. Equally, a question mark hangs over whether people will be prepared to abandon the relatively freer and more cosmopolitan — albeit more expensive — Dubai to move there.Saudi Arabia lags behind Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as a desirable destination for expats, according to an HSBC ranking.Oil-rich Saudi Arabia certainly doesn’t lack the money to make the necessary changes, but evidence so far suggests there’s a long way to go.Despite recent easing of some rules, alcohol, extramarital relations and homosexuality are punishable “moral crimes,” and there are limited options when it comes to western-style residential areas and international schools. And while football star Cristiano Ronaldo has been allowed to live with his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez after he joined a Saudi soccer team last year, few others are awarded the same privilege. Foreigners also complain about the length of time it takes to secure a work visa, even while tourism passes are easier to obtain.Teething Issues“There are infrastructure challenges and that’s where the teething issues are going to be, making sure there’s enough housing available, water, whether the road system can take it and so on,” said Metin Mitchell, who heads an executive recruitment firm that has been working in Saudi Arabia since 1995.Glitzy and futuristic real-estate projects in and around Riyadh like the Mukaab — billed as “the world’s first immersive, experiential destination” that will house commercial, residential, retail and cultural spaces — have been announced this year but the much-awaited masterplan for Riyadh’s expansion has been delayed multiple times. A metro system, which was set to be completed by 2019, has yet to open. Signs of trouble are also evident in the recent firing of the head of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City, the entity responsible for implementing the masterplan, suggesting frustration by the crown prince over a lack of progress.The RCRC didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment, though the Minister of Economy and Planning Faisal Alibrahim told Bloomberg TV: “Riyadh is ready today and it will be ready tomorrow when more people come in.”Housing Hunt On the ground, a looming housing deficit in Riyadh has significantly pushed up rental costs. Annual payments for a two-bedroom apartment in one of Riyadh’s better neighborhoods has gone up by almost 12% over the past year to about SAR 181,000 ($48,260), according to Faisal Durrani, partner and head of Middle East research at Knight Frank, a global real-estate brokerage and consultancy firm. He explained that’s due to a number of factors: more foreign professionals moving to Riyadh, limited availability in the housing compounds favored by Westerners due to relaxed dress rules, gyms and swimming pools, and a growing trend among young Saudis to move for job opportunities.It’s also become harder for candidates for jobs in Saudi Arabia to demand extravagant salaries in return for moving, reducing the incentive to go. A slowing global economy and massive layoffs at some international companies are giving both Saudi and multinational employers more leverage, according to Chris Rea, associate director at recruitment firm Michael Page’s Saudi practice.“It’s no longer a case of ‘I want a 50% increase to move’ — anyone who says that is pretty much a ‘no’ at the moment,” said Rea, adding that employees moving to Riyadh from Dubai could still get pay raises of 20%-25%.A senior producer with the Saudi-owned media company MBC Group, which plans to relocate most of its staff from Dubai to its new headquarters in Riyadh by 2024, said he and others are getting salary increases of at least 35% to 40% and guarantees they’ll keep their jobs for five years — yet still many are dreading the move.In Dubai you are an expatriate like the majority of people, but in Riyadh you have to deal with a local mindset, the producer said, declining to be named in order to speak freely about his concerns. Most expatriates will not be ready for the kind of lifestyle Riyadh entails, said a European woman who recruits for the kingdom’s expanding hospitality market. She moved to the Saudi capital from Dubai a year ago and cites being unable to practice Christianity freely and a blanket ban on alcohol as factors. Much Has ChangedStill, much has changed in Saudi Arabia. Women have joined the workforce in droves after Crown Prince Mohammed abolished strict dress codes, gender segregation and driving and travel restrictions. He has also curbed the power of the ultraconservative religious establishment that sought to impose its edicts by force on everyone, citizens and non-citizens.But at the same time foreigners coming to Saudi Arabia must remember that any criticism of the leadership and system can lead to expulsion, prison or worse. The UAE imposes similar freedom-of-expression restrictions, but has decriminalized cohabitation, allowed civil marriage and ended fees for liquor licenses.As Dubai becomes a more tolerant city, moving to Riyadh may seem a downgrade.For others there are complications of another kind.Brown, the Control Risks executive who is planning to move there over the next year, is trying to figure out a way to take his dogs with him: a Husky, a Saluki and a mixed-breed.Bringing pets to Riyadh is far more restrictive than Dubai.', 'The work on the strategic Zojila tunnel - an all-weather connection between the Kashmir valley and the Ladakh region -- is going on at a rapid pace and over 40 per cent of the drilling has been completed, the construction company said on Sunday. The company said it is hopeful of completing the project by December 2026.  The tunnel project - through the mighty Zojila Pass at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National highway - is of strategic importance as the highway remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall, cutting off Ladakh region from Kashmir.  The single-tube Zojila tunnel - from Baltal, in the Ganderbal district of central Kashmir, to Minimarg, in Drass town of Kargil district of Ladakh, is 13 km long with an approach road of 18 km.  \"This project is a huge game changer by the government of India. The total length of the project from Sonamarg to Minimarg is 31 km. From Sonamarg to Baltal, it is 18 km, and then the main tunnel from Baltal to Minimarg which is 13 km long. The work is going on at a rapid pace on both the projects,\" Project Head, Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited Harpal Singh told. MEIL is constructing the tunnel. Singh said the work had to be stopped for two months in the winter because of back-to-back avalanches in January in which two persons were killed. About 38 pieces of equipment of the construction company were buried under the snow which have not yet been retrieved. \"It was a temporary setback,\" Singh said, adding, \"I am hopeful that the whole project will be completed by December 2026\". Singh said out of the 13 km long tunnel, a total of 6 km cutting has been done - three km from this side and the rest from the other end. \"The remaining work will be completed in time,\" he said. The project head said the company is using a modern method of tunnelling which is known as new Austrian tunnelling method. \"By this method, we have achieved three important things -- the safety of the tunnel, the safety of the work-force, and the speed,\" he added.  By using this method, he said, the chances of accidents are very low and the quality and the speed of tunnelling are very good. This is a special technology applied in Europe and North America, he said. Out of the total 31 km project from Z-Morh tunnel in Sonamarg, to Baltal, the approach road is 18 km and the work is also going on their simultaneously. \"About 60 per cent of work has been completed on this. There are four bridges on which about 80 per cent of the work has been completed. There is five-km Nilgarh tunnels which have been completed. The work is going on at an advance pace and the approach road would be operational within two years,\" Singh said. He said people will not face any difficulty in coming to Baltal even in winter when there is heavy snowfall because of the approach road to the tunnel. Asked about the importance of the tunnel with respect to the Defence forces, Singh said after the completion of the tunnel, the forces will be able to move across round the clock. \"The road remains closed for four months due to snowfall. It is a very long time. There are so many defence forces personnel, we have a border with China which has a strong military. It is risky for our forces to face such a huge army when there is no land connection with the rest of India.  \"After this tunnel is constructed, the Indian defence forces will move uninterrupted throughout the year. People of J-K and Ladakh can move throughout the year. It will be a huge advantage. What we had not been able to do in the last 75 years, you will have it in the next three to four years,\" he said. He said not only will it shorten the distance, the time taken will also be very less. This distance will be covered in less than 40 minutes instead of four hours, he said. Site-incharge of MEIL, Sanjay Sharma, said the tunnel would be the longest in Asia at the highest altitude. He said there were many challenges working in the young Himalayan range. \"But, the main challenge is outside the tunnel. It is the weather. First two years, we worked in winter months also. But, last year, we had to stop for two months due to avalanches,\" he said.  Parliamentary consultative committee on Road Transport & Highways, led by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, is visiting the project site on Monday.', 'Two Indian-origin candidates are lined up to go head-to-head for the post of Leicester Mayor in the local elections coming up in the UK early next month. Conservative Party councillor Sanjay Modhwadia will compete with Rita Patel, a former Labour councillor who announced her bid recently in order to scrap the role. Patel, a Rushey Mead councillor from Leicester who will run as an independent, launched her campaign saying the city needed \"a fresh start\" and promised one of her first jobs will be to remove the mayoral role. Sitting Labour Mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, expressed disappointment at Patel\\'s exit from the party after she was one of four city councillors suspended for six months for their attempt to scrap the mayor\\'s office through a vote at a council meeting last month. Now the Tories have confirmed Modhwadia, a city councillor for North Evington, as their candidate to challenge Soulsby - who has held the job since it was created 12 years ago. He was in the eye of the storm when Leicester witnessed sectarian clashes last September following an India-Pakistan cricket match. Modhwadia, a local businessman, has been campaigning to push for a \"Made in Leicester\" brand to improve the city\\'s perception around the globe. While the Tories and Rita Patel have both said they want to get rid of the mayoral role, Leicester\\'s Green Party has promised a public referendum on the matter. The Green Party have chosen Mags Lewis - who also stood in 2019, finishing third - will be their candidate. The election is scheduled for May 4 and anyone elected may just go on to have a short stay in office. \"Many local residents have contacted our party in recent months to suggest that this is something we should do and our members have also voted in favour of removing the position of City Mayor,\" Richard Tutt, Chair of the City of Leicester Conservatives told \\'Leicester Mercury\\'. Many in the eastern England city believe the Leader of the Council system is more democratic and accountable for the people of Leicester.', 'GAIL Gas Ltd, on Sunday, announced a reduction in the prices of CNG and piped cooking gas by up to Rs 7, following a reduction in input gas price. The company has slashed the price of the gas that households received through piped natural gas, or PNG, by Rs 7 per standard cubic metre in Bengaluru and Dakshin Kannada and by Rs 6 per scm in other cities where the company operates. Similarly, CNG price has been cut by Rs 7 per kg in Karnataka and by Rs 6 in other areas, the company said in a statement. \"GAIL Gas Limited is also steering its pricing mechanism in line with the Government of India\\'s guideline to pass on new domestic gas pricing benefits to its customers and has announced a substantial reduction in prices with effect from April 9, 2023,\" it said. The new effective domestic PNG prices are Rs 52.50 per scm in Dewas, Meerut, Sonipat, Taj Trapezium Zone, Raisen, Mirzapur, Dhanbad, Adityapur and Rourkela, and Rs 51.50 per SCM for Bengaluru and Dakshin Kannada. Similarly, the new CNG price is Rs 85 per kg for Meerut and Sonipat; Rs 92 per kg for Dewas, Taj Trapezium Zone & Dehradun; Rs.82.50 per kg for Bengaluru & Dakshin Kannada; Rs 87 per kg for Mirzapur, Rs 91 per kg for Raisen, Dhanbad, Adityapur, Puri and Rourkela. This follows the government revising the formula for the pricing of natural gas, which is converted into CNG for running automobiles and piped into household kitchens for cooking purposes. The revised formula and the cap or ceiling price imposed has brought down the price of natural gas to USD 6.5 per million British thermal units from USD 8.57. \"The new guidelines aim to establish a stable pricing regime for domestic gas consumers while providing sufficient protection to producers from adverse market fluctuations, along with incentives to user industries and the CGD sector. It will accelerate the expansion of CNG and PNG as a preferred fuel, and will also contribute to reducing the carbon footprint,\" the statement said.', 'The United States has increased the fee for tourist and students seeking visa.

The country\\'s largest car maker had sold 2.02 lakh sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in the last financial year with a market share of nearly 13 per cent. However, in FY24, the company aims to sell around 5 lakh units.  The SUV segment is currently the fastest-growing vertical in the domestic passenger vehicle industry.  The SUV contribution to the overall passenger vehicle market has grown from 24 per cent in 2018 to 43 per cent in 2022. Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Officer (Sales & Marketing) Shashank Srivastava said the doubling of the market share in the SUV segment would also help the company in its bid to again surpass the 50 per cent market share mark in the domestic passenger vehicle industry.  \"This fiscal year we expect our SUV market share to rise to 25 per cent. The SUV market is expected to be around 19 lakh units this year,\" PTI quoted Srivastava as saying.  For the company, Brezza is leading the entry SUV segment while a full impact of Grand Vitara in terms of sales is also expected to come into play this year, he noted.  Besides, the addition of two new models -- Jimny and Fronx -- would also help in bringing in additional volumes this fiscal, he added.  Srivastava noted that MSI has already received close to 41,000 bookings for the two models which are slated to hit the market over the next few months.  He noted that the company\\'s SUV market share has been increasing over the last few fiscal. It stood at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 and increased to 13 per cent last fiscal, he stated.  \"We ended the fourth quarter at around 17 per cent. So we have gained market share due to the better availability of Brezza and the introduction of Grand Vitara. And now Fronx and Jimny should give us additional numbers. So we are hoping that we will be number one in the SUV space this year,\" Srivastava said.  MSI competes with Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Hyundai Motor India for the top slot in the SUV space.  Srivastava said the company\\'s market share in the non-SUV segment stood at around 65 per cent but due to low penetration in the SUV segment, its overall market share has gone below the 45 per cent level.  \"If we want to increase it towards 50 per cent, we will have to increase our market share in the SUV space and this is what we are trying to do,\" he added.  When asked if the current product range would be sufficient to make gains in the segment, Srivastava said: \"With these four vehicles, we hope that we can be the leading player in the segment.\"  MSI also remains bullish on the CNG segment despite an increase in the price of the fuel impacting the overall sales in the vertical. Despite the increase in prices, the company sold 3.25 lakh units last fiscal as compared with 2.34 lakh units in 2021-22, Srivastava said.  So the growth was like 45-46 per cent and our total penetration went from 17 per cent to 20 per cent in FY23, he added.  \"We now have 75 per cent market share in the CNG space (passenger vehicle segment) and going forward our sales projection for this fiscal is over 4.5 lakh units,\" Srivastava noted.  MSI currently sells 14 company models with a CNG option.  When asked if the company aims to expand the model range further, Srivastava said: \"We are looking very closely at the market because if there is a downward revision of the prices going ahead then we can see even larger traction compared to what we have seen last year.\"  The company is watching the market closely and if required would study if CNG technology could be introduced in other models as well, he added.  On the company\\'s plans regarding the electric segment, Srivastava said the company plans to have six battery electric vehicles in its portfolio by 2030.  The six models would account roughly for 15 per cent of the company\\'s overall product range.  MSI plans to drive its first battery electric vehicle in the next financial year, Srivastava noted. \"In 2030, the overall portfolio of the company will look something like..60 per cent will be CNG and internal combustion engine vehicles, 25 per cent would be hybrid and 15 per cent will be electric,\" he said.(With inputs from PTI)', 'China\\'s military simulated precision strikes against Taiwan in a second day of drills around the island on Sunday, with the island\\'s defence ministry reporting multiple air force sorties and that it was monitoring China\\'s missile forces. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, began three days of military exercises around the island on Saturday, the day after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a brief visit to the United States. Chinese state television reported that the combat readiness patrols and drills around Taiwan were continuing. \"Under the unified command of the theatre joint operations command centre, multiple types of units carried out simulated joint precision strikes on key targets on Taiwan island and the surrounding sea areas, and continue to maintain an offensive posture around the island,\" it said. A Taiwan security source told Reuters that on Saturday the Chinese drills around the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines, included simulated attacks on aircraft carrier groups as well as anti-submarine drills. Taiwan\\'s defence ministry said that as of Sunday midday (0400 GMT) they had spotted 58 Chinese aircraft, including Su-30 fighters and H-6 bombers, as well as nine ships, around Taiwan. The ministry said they were paying particular attention to the People\\'s Liberation Army\\'s Rocket Force which is in charge of China\\'s land-based missile system. \"Regarding the movements of the Chinese communists\\' Rocket Force, the nation\\'s military also has a close grasp through the joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance system, and air defence forces remain on high alert,\" the ministry said. It reiterated that Taiwan\\'s forces will \"not escalate conflicts nor cause disputes\" and would respond \"appropriately\" to China\\'s drills. \\'COMFORTABLE, CONFIDENT\\' U.S. MONITORS DRILLS Life in Taiwan has continued as normal, with no sign of panic or disruption from the Chinese drills. Last August, following a visit to Taipei by Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, China staged war games around Taiwan, including firing missiles into waters close to the island. It has not announced similar drills this time. While in Los Angeles last week, on what was officially billed a transit on her way back from Central America, Tsai met the current speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, despite Beijing\\'s warnings against it. The de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan said on Sunday the United States was monitoring China\\'s drills around Taiwan closely and is \"comfortable and confident\" it has sufficient resources and capabilities regionally to ensure peace and stability. U.S. channels of communication with China remain open and the United States had consistently urged restraint and no change to the status quo, said a spokesperson for the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as an embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Washington severed diplomatic relations with Taipei in favour of Beijing in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control, says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relations with the United States, and the topic is a frequent source of tensions. Beijing considers Tsai a separatist and has rebuffed her repeated calls for talks. Tsai says only Taiwan\\'s people can decide their future. CHINESE FIGHTERS, WARSHIPS China has over the past three years or so stepped up its military pressure against Taiwan, flying regular missions around Taiwan, though not in its territorial air space or over the island itself. Taiwan\\'s defence ministry said earlier on Sunday that in the previous 24 hours it had spotted 71 Chinese air force aircraft and nine navy vessels around Taiwan. The ministry published a map showing around half of those aircraft, including Su-30s and J-11s, crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which has for years served as an unofficial barrier between the two sides. Chinese state media said the aircraft were armed with live weapons. Taiwanese air force jets also typically carry live weapons when they scramble to see off Chinese incursions.  Late on Saturday, Taiwan\\'s Ocean Affairs Council, which runs the Coast Guard, put out footage on its YouTube channel showing one of its ships shadowing a Chinese warship, though did not give an exact location. \"You are seriously harming regional peace, stability and security. Please immediately turn around and leave. If you continue to proceed we will take expulsion measures,\" a Coast Guard officer says by radio to the Chinese ship. Other footage showed a Taiwanese warship, the Di Hua, accompanying the Coast Guard ship in what the Coast Guard officer calls a \"standoff\" with the Chinese warship. Still, civilian flights around Taiwan, including to Kinmen and Matsu, two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands right next to the Chinese coast, have continued as normal.  In August, civilian air traffic was disrupted after China announced effective no-fly zones in several blocks close to Taiwan where it was firing missiles.', 'The summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is getting a makeover — in patches. Some components of the ongoing smart city project in Srinagar have been tweaked, with contracts being reworked and deadlines advanced by a month or two, to have them completed ahead of a G20 tourism working group meeting to be held between May 22 and 24. Road construction equipment is strewn across busy lanes as well as along the Jhelum riverfront — the stretches that are being redesigned with parks, bicycle tracks and pedestrian-friendly pathways. Projects have been prioritised on the basis of what the G20 delegates will see. For example, the redevelopment of the 2.5-km-long Maulana Azad Road, which connects the civil secretariat to the boulevard along the Dal Lake, is a priority project whereas there is no urgency in completing the nearby Regency Road project.“Because of the G20 event, we are concentrating on the left bank of the Jhelum. We will redo only a portion of the right bank, about 500 m, which will be visible to the delegates as they pass through the road,” says Iftikhar Ahmad Kakroo, chief engineer of Srinagar Smart City. “In total, we will complete smart city projects worth about Rs 200 crore ahead of the G20 meet.” One section of the Indira Gandhi Road, which connects Srinagar airport with the rest of the city, is being refurbished, says Kakroo. Muhammed Mumtaz, a painter working on the riverfront, says, “We are told to accelerate work because an international meeting will be held in the city soon. About 200 workers like me have been working only on this stretch.” The proposed itinerary of foreign delegates, which includes a shikara ride on Dal Lake as well as a visit to the ski resort of Gulmarg and the Dachigam National Park known for hangul (the Kashmiri stag), indicates this international event could underscore New Delhi’s attempt to package Kashmir, again, as a tourist hub.This will be the biggest meet in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019, which ended the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and saw a massive deployment of security forces, house arrest of prominent politicians and the blocking of internet for months, inviting backlash even from a section of global community. Since then, New Delhi has gone on a diplomatic overdrive to convince the world that it is India’s internal matter. Today, only Pakistan, which is not a G20 member, is lobbying hard against the event in Kashmir in the hope that a handful of members such as China, Turkey and Saudi Arabia would oppose it.The other members of the bloc are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States and the European Union. G20’s importance lies in the fact that its members represent about 85% of the global gross domestic product, 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world population. Under India’s presidency (which runs from December 1, 2022 to November 30, 2023), nine guest members have been included — Bangladesh, Egypt, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Singapore, Spain and the UAE. In a G20 briefing in New York on March 13, India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ruchira Kamboj said India was taking G20 to 56 cities “across the length and breadth of the country, from Kashmir in the north to Kanyakumari in the south”, making it clear that the country is going ahead with the Srinagar event.During India’s presidency, over 200 meetings — four sherpa meetings, 20 ministerial and 1 parliament speakers’ meeting apart from several senior official level meetings — will be held across India, covering all the 28 states and 8 Union territories. All these meetings will firm up the priorities under India’s presidency, which will be reflected in the agenda paper of the Leaders’ Summit to be held on September 9-10 in Delhi.TOUR PACKAGESo, what is the big message that New Delhi would like to convey through the Kashmir meeting? India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant tells ET: “Kashmir is a tourist haven with ecotourism and adventure tourism being brought to the forefront with the likes of skiing and the iconic shikara, the houseboat that depicts the blend of luxury and rich heritage Kashmir offers. The message that lies with the G20 meeting being scheduled in Kashmir is clear — presenting Kashmir, as a truly transformed, exotic valley, with its rich culture and heritage, to the world.”Kashmir Tourism has prepared a blueprint for the event, including a cultural show at the airport to welcome delegates, a day-trip to Gulmarg where the delegates will ride on the gondola, a musical extravaganza at Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre, the main venue of the conference, and lunch at Dachigam, according to a local tourism official requesting anonymity. “The Dachigam Park is known for hangul but the delegates are unlikely to spot it as the antelope prefers dense jungle,” he says.The official says arrangements have been made for 160 persons, including foreign delegates and select Indian officials, most of whom will be accommodated in Srinagar’s Taj Vivanta and Lalit Grand Palace. Local millets will be served to delegates, either for lunch or dinner, adds the official, as 2023 is being celebrated as the International Year of Millets.Kant says Kashmir’s handloom products such as the pashmina shawl will be displayed in front of the delegates. “International delegates will get a firsthand opportunity to view the tremendous potential of agriculture (millets, apples), horticulture (saffron) and floriculture that Kashmir offers. These crops also hold potential for high-value addition to the local economy since they garner high international demand,” he adds.Tourism in Kashmir Valley was severely hit first by the suspension of its special status and then by the Covid pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns since March 2020.According to the reply to a Rajya Sabha question, the number of tourists visiting Kashmir from August 5, 2019, to February 2, 2021, were 84,326 as against 87,94,837 to Jammu. “Since August, 5, 2019, the number of tourist arrivals in Jammu & Kashmir has declined. The impact was felt more severely in the Kashmir Valley than in the Jammu division. However, the tourist footfall in J&K is gradually increasing in the last few months,” said the then minister of state for tourism (independent charge) Prahlad Singh Patel on February 2, 2021. According to Kashmir Tourism data, the Valley attracted 2.3 million tourists in 2022, up from 0.66 million in 2021 and a mere 41,000 in 2020.Under the new industrial policy for Jammu and Kashmir announced in 2021, 5,327 investment proposals have been made. The anticipated investment amount is Rs 66,000 crore, according to a written reply from the Ministry of Home Affairs to a Rajya Sabha question on March 23.As far as terrorism-related incidents are concerned, there has been a marginal improvement since 2019. The number of security personnel killed were 78 in 2019, 56 in 2020, 45 in 2021 and 30 in 2022, according to data compiled by South Asia Terrorism Portal. The number of civilians killed were 42 in 2019, 33 in 2020, 36 in 2021 and 30 in 2022. As reported in the local media in the first week of March, Director General of J&K Police Dilbag Singh has said that elaborate security arrangements have been made for the G20 meet.Many residents and shopkeepers whom ET spoke to have expressed two major complaints — one, their locality has turned so dusty due to construction work that it is no longer livable, and two, the town planners, they claim, have reduced the size of carriageways. Muhammad Ashraf, a houseboat owner on the Jhelum, says, “In the name of creating footpaths and bicycle tracks, the authority has narrowed the main roads. Is this correct?”Chief engineer Kakroo says, “We are making carriageways uniform by correcting some patches. The problem with Maulana Azad Road, for example, is that it is wide in many places but narrow in others. That’s why we see traffic jams.” He adds that each carriageway will be 8.5 m wide, enough for the smooth passage of vehicles. Some local entrepreneurs are happy.They believe the G20 meeting and the redesigned patches of the lake city will give Kashmir tourism a new lease of life. In and around Srinagar, there are 856 registered houseboats — a majority of them (595) are on the Dal lake; with the rest scattered on the Nigeen lake and the Jhelum river, among others. “From last year, there has been no tourism season as such. Tourists have arrived in big numbers in winter and summer. Once the renovation of the city is over, there will be record number of tourists,” says Farooq Ahmed, 56, a shikara owner on the Dal.', 'Adani group\\'s corporate brand custodian and head of corporate affairs Aman Kumar Singh, who is facing a corruption charge in Chhattisgarh, has resigned from the board of NDTV Ltd due to other preoccupations. In a stock exchange filing, New Delhi Television Ltd last week said, \"Aman Kumar Singh has tendered his resignation from the position of non-executive director of the company, with effect from close of business hours on April 1, 2023, due to his preoccupation with other engagements\". Singh, a former Indian Revenue Service Officer, was a powerful bureaucrat in the Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh and was the principal secretary to the chief minister. He resigned from service and joined the Adani group in November 2022 as the Corporate Brand Custodian and Corporate Affairs head. And when Adani took control of NDTV, Singh was one of the directors the Adani group appointed to the board of the news broadcaster. In February 2020, the economic offences wing (EOW) of Chhattisgarh registered an FIR against Singh and his wife Yasmeen Singh in an alleged disproportionate assets case. The High Court quashed the FIR, but the Supreme Court last month set aside the HC order, saying it was desirable that the High Courts do not quash corruption case FIRs at the investigation stage, even if it is suspected that the case has been registered by a new government against officers of the previous government. After the Supreme Court order, Aman Singh appeared before the EOW on March 6. A week later, his plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by an additional district and sessions judge court in Raipur. Singh is the second nominee of the Adani group to have resigned from the NDTV board. On March 9, NDTV, in a stock exchange filing, stated that Sunil Kumar has resigned as an additional non-executive independent director of the company. Kumar, a 1979-batch IAS officer, was chief secretary of Chhattisgarh from 2012 to 2014.', \"The government is likely to set up the 16th finance commission this year to suggest, among other things, the ratio in which tax is to be divided between the Centre and states for five years, beginning April 1, 2026, an official said. The members of the commission and its Terms of Reference (ToR) are being worked out, the official added. Finance Commission is a constitutional body that gives suggestions on Centre-state financial relations. The previous Finance Commission submitted its report on November 9, 2020, for the 5 fiscals -- 2021-22 to 2025-26 -- to the President. The 15th Commission under NK Singh had kept the tax devolution ratio at 42 per cent -- at the same level suggested by the 14th Commission. The central government accepted the report of the commission, and accordingly, the states are being given 42 per cent of the divisible tax pool of the Centre during the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. The 15th finance commission's recommendations include the fiscal deficit, debt path for the Union and states, and additional borrowing room to states based on performance in power sector reforms. As per the glide path for fiscal consolidation, the government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the 2025-26 fiscal. For the current fiscal, the deficit is projected at 5.9 per cent of GDP, lower than 6.4 per cent in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2023.\", 'There were no cameras. No media. It was all rather quiet as an International Olympic Committee (IOC) delegation reached the Government Girls High School, in VSS Nagar, Bhubaneswar. It is one of the 90 schools in Odisha under the Olympic Values Education Programme (OVEP), that’s providing underprivileged children in the state free and easy access to sports and education. With the mercury touching 37 degrees, outdoor activities with school kids in sapping heat did not appear a very promising prospect. Yet, kids from an economically underprivileged background, smartly dressed in well-ironed school uniforms, lined up to welcome the delegation, which was led by Angelita Teo, Director of the Olympic Foundation of Culture and Heritage, and accompanied by Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra. They were given a proper traditional welcome with flowers and conch shells. As they took their seats in front of the temporary stage, two students, a boy and a girl, walked up to the dais and welcomed everyone in perfect English. They were addressing a crowd of around 150 and mentioned what all they had planned for the day and how sport had made them more confident individuals. It was followed by a mixed-team game of six-a-side (three girls, three boys) football. Two teams were pitted against each other with three players instructed not to go beyond the half line. “Some of the boys can be better players at the moment but that’s not relevant here. We have stopped them from going beyond the half line because it will mean they have to pass the ball to their teammates to be able to score. That will help unite them as a team. Individual efforts don’t matter. And by passing on to their female counterparts, they will learn to respect each other more. Over a period of time, some girls have become as good if not better than the boys and are now leaders of their teams,” said a senior teacher of the school. “I was apprehensive of playing football. I was told it was a game for boys only. And then one day I fell and injured myself. My parents were scared of what might happen to me. But my teachers and trainers encouraged me to keep going and now I love football. I am playing for a club and if It goes well, I want to play the sport professionally,” said one of the girls. Bindra’s eyes lit up seeing the girl speak. From shooting for the Olympic gold to watching tribal kids playing football is quite a journey. “For me sport is about values, life lessons. Not about medals,” said Bindra, whose Abhinav Bindra Foundation is a partner in the IOC project in India. “Yes, the Olympic gold medal has its importance and it has helped me hugely but it is not something I wear around my neck everyday and it doesn’t define who I am. What sport has helped me do is make change. Sport has helped me change as well. In fact, it has shaped me as an individual and that’s why I am here. If sport can help change lives and make for better societies, I would say my 22 years in sport are of some significance,” he added. By then the football had ended and the kids had made their way to the sand art, which had been prepared for the delegation. Again, it was done using the same principles of friendship, respect and excellence. “What is striking here is how the teachers and students are working in perfect synergy using sporting values. That’s what Olympism and the Olympic movement is all about,” Teo said. “If we can touch lives like this with sport, we will request Abhinav to take the programme to every corner of India,” she added. In sport, you always fail in public. Even the great Sachin Tendulkar did so in the 2007 World Cup when he was out for a duck in the do-or-die game. He wanted to retire. Thankfully, he didn’t. He came back and helped India win the World Cup in 2011. And yes, in public, in front of millions. That’s why sport is unique. The only thing that allows you to fail in public and then come back and win in public. That’s what Bindra and his team are trying to teach 1,50,000 young girls and boys in Odisha: how to deal with failure, how to lose and come back stronger, how not to lose hope and be invested in the process. The OVEP’s journey has just started in India. And within a year, it’s shown the promise to be a powerful tool of change.', 'There were no cameras. No media.

But the purchases appear to have plateaued as growth has slowed. Russia continued to be the single largest supplier of crude oil, which is converted into petrol and diesel at refineries, for a sixth straight month by supplying more than one-third of all oil India imported, according to energy cargo tracker Vortexa.  Refiners continue to snap up plentiful Russian cargo available at a discount to other grades.  From a market share of less than 1 per cent in India\\'s import basket before the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Russia\\'s share of India\\'s imports rose to 1.64 million barrels per day in March, taking a 34 per cent share.  The purchases from Russia in March were double of 0.82 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil bought from Iraq, which has been India\\'s top oil supplier since 2017-18.  India, the world\\'s third-largest crude importer after China and the United States, has been snapping Russian oil that was available at a discount after some in the West shunned it as a means of punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.  Month-on-month, purchases from Russia rose marginally from 1.62 million bpd of oil imported from the country in February.  According to Vortexa, Saudi Arabia was India\\'s second largest supplier of crude oil in March, selling 986,288 bpd. Iraq with 821,952 bpd sales was the third biggest supplier.  UAE overtook the US to become the fourth largest supplier at 313,002 bpd. The US supplied 136,464 bpd, down from 248,430 bpd in February.  \"While India continues to increase its imports of Russian crude month-on-month in March, the growth has slowed,\" said Vortexa\\'s head of Asia-Pacific analysis, Serena Huang.  \"Refiners\\' purchases of medium-sour Russian Urals have remained steady in March, and the increase in imports are attributed to higher purchases of sweeter grades like Novy Port Light.\"  India\\'s import of Russian oil could have plateaued.  \"The plateauing of India\\'s imports of Russian Urals could indicate a soft limit on its ability to take in more sour crude, given its need to fulfill its term contracts with Mideast Gulf producers.  \"But domestic refiners do have room to increase their purchases of sweeter grades like Sokol, ESPO blend and Novy Port Light, in the interest of maintaining refining runs high and diversifying its crude sources,\" Huang said.  Russia is selling record amounts of crude oil to India to plug the gap in its energy exports after the European Union banned imports in December.  In December, the EU banned Russian seaborne oil and imposed a USD 60-per-barrel price cap, which prevents other countries from using EU shipping and insurance services, unless oil is sold below the cap.  Industry officials said Indian refiners are using UAE\\'s dirham to pay for oil that is imported at a price lower than USD 60.  \"Almost a quarter of the Russian imports are now paid in dirham,\" an official said.  According to Vortexa, India imported just 68,600 bpd of oil from Russia in March 2022 and this year the purchases have jumped to 1,646,311 bpd.  Year-on-year, imports from Iraq have fallen from 1,139,880 bpd in March 2022 to 821,952 bpd this year. The biggest drop, however, has been in the US imports - from 419,071 bpd to 136,464 bpd.  Saudi Arabia is selling more oil as compared to 872,683 bpd it sold in March last year.', \"According to data released by the Union Health Ministry, India reported 5,357 fresh cases of COVID-19, and 11 more deaths. Active cases in the country rose to 32, 814 with the fresh addition, while the death toll rose to 5,30,965. Gujarat reported three deaths, while Himachal Pradesh reported two and one each was reported from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh besides one reconciled by Kerala, the data updated at 8 am stated.  The Covid case tally was recorded at 4.47 crore (4,47,56,616) Active cases are now 0.07% of the total cases, while the recovery rate in the country was recorded at 98.74%, the ministry said.  The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 4,41,92,837 while the case fatality rate was recorded at 1.19 per cent.  According to the ministry's website, 220.66 crore doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in the country so far under the nationwide vaccination drive.\", 'India-Japan-Bangladesh will organise a mega meet in Tripura on April 11-12 to put in place connectivity initiatives to harness commercial potential of the region. The meet will be attended by Deputy Foreign Ministers of India and Bangladesh besides Chief Minister of Tripura and Japanese envoy to India.Officials told ET that greater involvement of Japan will pave the way for industrial value chains, comprehensive connectivity development of Northeast India and Bangladesh. Japan is investing in NE India and Bangladesh including deep sea port at Matarbari in Bangladesh that will connect the landlocked region with Bay of Bengal. Leading think tank from North East India Asian Confluence that is organising this meet in collaboration with MEA in a recently conducted study suggested that both Northeast India and Bangladesh need to scale up the multi-modal connectivity, which would not only help the region to raise its competitiveness but also narrow the development gaps in the region. In parallel, both entities should work together to bring synergy in trade facilitation and build express corridors for the transhipment and transit of goods from Northeast Region to Chattogram Port of Bangladesh, the study further suggested. The study also suggested creation of industrial value chains to create a win-win situation for all stakeholders in India and Bangladesh and Japanese companies in the region. It was also suggested to establish Japan-Northeast India Chamber of Commerce to promote Japanese investment in NE India, and a NE India-Bangladesh-Japan CEO Forum so that it can provide the required business leadership. ', 'Long-term survival of family-run businesses depends on their ability to adapt to changes, inculcate right governance practices and having a succession plan in place, said HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh.\"Those that truly believe in corporate governance and its benefits are the ones that succeed over the long run,\" Parekh said Saturday. \"It is quite right when they say that well-run family businesses think in generations and not in quarters – or what is popularly known as “quarter se quarter tak”. Short-termism has often been the downfall of many organisations,\" he said at an event at Viraasat, celebrating silver jubilee of SPJIMR: Centre for Family Business & Entrepreneurship.Parekh lauded the focus on education by family-run entrepreneurs for their younger generation, dubbing it the \"biggest gamechangee\" in family businesses today\". \"Better education has helped bring in scale, vision, professionalism and diversification in businesses. Armed with better education, there is a deeper understanding of changing market realities which helps family businesses stay relevant,\" the veteran professional said.Another significant step towards achieving success in such business houses is the ability to invite professionals in their board. \"The harder decisions in family owned businesses is the ability to honestly address issues on gaps in the company. The million dollar question is when should the family make way for non-family professionals? Having a strong, diverse and inclusive board without conflicts of interest helps family owned entities navigate through sensitive issues and tough decisions,\" he said.Many large Indian family owned businesses today have boards that are inclusive, diverse, focus on sustainability and philanthropy. They actively seek out independent, professional directors – be it from the overseas or in India. They want governance structures that are best-in-class and many of them have strong ambitions to create a global footprint, Parekh said.', 'As the fortunes of Richard Branson\\'s Virgin Orbit were crashing to Earth last month, a little-known investor called Matthew Brown appeared offering a $200 million rescue. Within two days of being contacted by Brown, Virgin Orbit Chief Executive Dan Hart had secured board backing for a preliminary agreement with the 33-year-old Texas-based investor, according to related documents and email exchanges reviewed by Reuters and three people with knowledge of the discussions. \"We have had our board meeting this morning with agreement to move forward, so I now have the buy-in I need,\" Hart told Brown in a March 21 email seen by Reuters. In a separate email to staff that day, Hart offered a hopeful note for Virgin Orbit\\'s 750 workers, most of who had been furloughed to save cash when the company halted its business earlier in March. In the email, Hart said the Long Beach, California-based company would begin an \"incremental resumption\" of operations.There would be no full resumption of operations. The potential deal with Brown unraveled in less than a week with Virgin Orbit severing contact and threatening to take legal action against him if he revealed confidential details about the potential investment, according to the cease-and-desist letter reviewed by Reuters, and the three people, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The previously unreported details of a deal that was never done provide a window into Virgin Orbit\\'s failed scramble to avoid bankruptcy. The company, which had been worth $3.8 billion in late 2022 and counted the U.S. military among its biggest clients, filed for Chapter 11 this week. Hart, a former Boeing veteran, did not respond to a request for comment on the talks with Brown. Virgin Group, which owns 75% of Virgin Orbit, also declined to comment for this article. The group is providing financing to Virgin Orbit as the satellite launch company seeks a buyer in bankruptcy. The legal notice was in response to an interview Brown gave on CNBC on March 23 when he said he was in \"final discussions\" to close a $200 million investment in Virgin Orbit within 24 hours. The letter from a lawyer for the company said Brown had overstated the nature of talks and breached a non-disclosure agreement. Virgin Orbit\\'s cratering stock price bounced more than 60% on the day after Brown\\'s CNBC appearance. The TV interview followed a report from Reuters that said Brown was nearing a deal for a proposed investment in the company, citing the term sheet signed by Hart and Brown and the planned closing date of March 24. When the company cut contact with Brown, on March 25, it had uncovered issues with Brown\\'s credibility, the three people said. One said executives found evidence that contradicted details Brown had provided about his background. In interviews with Reuters over the past week, Brown dismissed accusations he had misrepresented himself. He said Virgin Orbit had not provided information he had wanted before he was comfortable transferring the $200 million into an escrow account as agreed in the term sheet. Brown did not specify the information he had sought and Reuters was unable to independently verify his assertion. \"I absolutely, 100%, had the money,\" Brown added. \\'LAYING LOW BELOW THE RADAR\\'Reuters found apparent discrepancies in several key elements of assertions made by Brown on CNBC or on LinkedIn about the companies where he says he had worked, his investments and associates. Brown told Reuters he had no shares in Virgin Orbit and had not profited from taking his bid public and the short-lived stock price jump that followed. The company\\'s bankruptcy filing on Tuesday showed a \"Matthew Brown\" as holding 238 shares at the time of the filing. Those shares were worth $48 on Thursday. Brown said the listed investor was a different Matthew Brown. Reuters could not find corporate registrations for two companies where Brown said on LinkedIn he had been an adviser or partner: Hong Kong-based Hogshead Spouter and Hawaii-based Kona Private Capital. Brown told Reuters he worked through offshore entities, without providing details. He said he did not know where Kona and Hogshead were registered. In his CNBC interview, Brown said he had worked with OpenAI. An OpenAI spokesperson said it had never worked with him. Asked about this, Brown told Reuters he structured deals to protect investor confidentiality with a preference for \"laying low below the radar.\" At the time of his Virgin Orbit approach, Brown\\'s LinkedIn page included an endorsement from Dan McDermott, identified as a former colleague at Hogshead Spouter and as a former official with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The central bank said it had no record of having employed McDermott. Contacted by LinkedIn, McDermott declined to answer questions about his background. Brown said he had worked for Woods Family Office, a Houston-based private wealth firm, from 2008 to 2021, beginning at the age of 18 in the role of CEO managing $6 billion then as a senior adviser. The family office, whose website identifies Eric Woods as the principal, did not reply to a request for comment. When queried about his firm via LinkedIn, Eric Woods said: \"I have nothing to say and my family office doesn\\'t either.\" He added: \"While Matt is an adviser, we\\'re not affiliated with Matt\\'s purchase of Virgin, which I assume this is about.\" Following a Reuters inquiry to LinkedIn about whether Woods\\' and McDermott\\'s accounts were genuine, both accounts were taken down. LinkedIn declined to discuss the specific cases but said its policy was to remove accounts it found to be fraudulent. Brown said he couldn\\'t speak for the two men or address why their LinkedIn accounts had been suspended. He added Woods was \"a great man and a very successful man\" and \"from what I remember of Dan, incredible human being.\" \\'LOOSE CHANGE\\'Brown told Reuters he was a producer on a 2009 documentary, \"Loose Change\", which suggested the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy by the U.S. government. Korey Rowe and Dylan Avery, partners in the project, said they gave Brown a producing credit when the film was released. Brown had given Avery a camera, Avery told Reuters. Both Rowe and Avery said Brown failed to pay thousands of dollars in recording studio costs that he had verbally promised, and they cut his credit on later versions of the film. Brown said he provided a \"reasonable\" amount of funding and that his split with the two \"came down to a difference in personalities.\" Virgin Orbit filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday. It never recovered from a failed January mission that sent a payload of satellites into the ocean.

The government in its union budget had allocated '4,800 crore including '2,500 crore exclusively for road connectivity for the Financial Years 2022-23 to 2025-26.The VVP is a centrally sponsored scheme under which 2,967 villages in 46 blocks of 19 districts abutting the northern border in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Ladakh have been identified for comprehensive development. In the first phase, 662 villages have been identified for priority coverage, which includes 455 villages in Arunachal Pradesh. \", 'Inside a secretive government laboratory, behind a tall fence and armed guards, a team of engineers has been dissecting the innards of the newest all-electric vehicles with a singular goal: Rewrite tailpipe-pollution rules to speed up the nation\\'s transition to electric cars. As early as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to propose ambitious greenhouse gas emission standards for cars that are so stringent that they\\'re designed to ensure that at least half the new vehicles sold in the United States are all-electric by 2030, up from just 5.8% today. And the rules could put the nation on track to end sales of new gasoline-powered cars as soon as 2035. Transportation is the largest source of the greenhouse gases generated by the United States, and scientists say that slashing pollution from tailpipes - fast - is essential to averting the most catastrophic impacts of global warming. But that would also require overcoming myriad technical and logistical challenges: Electric vehicles are still too expensive for most consumers, in part because of snarled global supply chains for the materials to build them. The cars also need a national network of millions of easy-to-use fast-charging stations. The work taking place in the EPA\\'s automotive research laboratory puts it at the center of one the most complex balancing acts faced by President Joe Biden. He has pledged to fight climate change, and gas-burning cars are a major source of planet-warming pollution. But automobile manufacturing is one of the nation\\'s most important industries, and a rapid switch to electric vehicles, which require less labor to manufacture, has the potential to displace thousands of autoworkers, an important constituency for Biden. \"This is the biggest transformation that the auto industry has ever seen, as it moves from 100 years of tailpipe pollution to electric vehicles - and an entirely new way to drive,\" said David Haugen, director of EPA\\'s National Fuel and Vehicle Emissions Laboratory. \"Any one thing can keep it from happening,\" he said, acknowledging the challenges of building charging stations, creating domestic supply chains, and bringing down prices. \"Any of those things can make the adoption a struggle. All the pieces have to be there.\" Testing the limits of technology The Biden administration wants to use the EPA\\'s authority to regulate pollution from tailpipes to set a standard so demanding that it would compel automakers to eventually produce only electric vehicles. But to do that, experts at the EPA laboratory have to first determine how much electric vehicle technology is likely to advance in the next decade to help the agency set the strongest tailpipe emissions limits that are still achievable. To that end, government experts in technology, chemistry, toxicology and law at the lab have been working with engineers from the world\\'s biggest car companies. They have been taking apart and testing the innards of new and not-yet-on-the-market Teslas, GMs, Volkswagens and Nissans to figure out which existing technology can go the farthest and fastest; which is the sturdiest and most durable; and which is equipped with the most affordable components. Different models have different strengths - no single make possesses every component of an affordable, muscular, family-friendly, wide-ranging electric vehicle, researchers said. They have driven electric cars on giant treadmills continuously, in 12-hour shifts, to see how many miles they can travel on a single charge. They have heated the cars to nearly 100 degrees and then frozen them overnight to assess battery strength. They have run hours and hours of computer simulations. \"Observing these technologies gives us a lot of confidence that this can happen,\" Haugen said. \"This regulation will help all the automakers move at the fastest pace they possibly can so that we can address climate change with the urgency it deserves.\" \\'We\\'ve never seen anything like what\\'s coming now\\' One factor weighing heavily on the administration is the effect that new tailpipe limits could have on jobs, such as those at Ford\\'s century-old Rouge manufacturing complex, about 40 miles east of the EPA laboratory. There, autoworkers and their union leaders worry about what the coming regulation means for their future. They have good reason: Electric vehicles require fewer than half the number of workers to assemble than cars with internal combustion engines. \"We know we will lose jobs through this at some point,\" Mark DePaoli, a vice president of the United Auto Workers Local 600, said in a recent interview at the local\\'s headquarters, near the Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan. To understand what\\'s at stake, compare the chassis of the Ford F-150 pickup truck - the top-selling passenger vehicle in the United States - with its all-electric version, both built at the Rouge complex. The gas-powered F-150 is composed of thousands of small metal parts and pieces and is assembled by 4,200 employees in the conventional truck plant. The all-electric Ford F-150 is essentially a giant battery attached to motors and wheels that is built by about 720 workers next door, at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center. As the transition from gasoline-powered to all-electric speeds up, one of the roughly 150,000 unionized auto jobs nationwide that could be lost might belong to Steve Noffke, who has built internal combustion engines for Ford for 25 years. \"I\\'m not opposed to electric vehicles, don\\'t get me wrong,\" said Noffke, 69. \"If this transition is going to take place, we understand that; most of us have been through transitions before. But we, as workers, shouldn\\'t have to pay for it.\" Noffke noted that his industry has seen plenty of disruption to this point. The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement sent thousands of auto manufacturing jobs to Mexico. The 2008 financial crisis pushed automakers to the brink of collapse. Advances in automation continue to replace people with robots. In Dearborn, scars from some of that dislocation are still evident in empty factories, an abandoned Payless Shoes store and a boarded-up Brown\\'s Bun Bakery. But the changes being wrought by electric vehicles are significantly more jarring, Noffke said. \"We\\'ve never seen anything like what\\'s coming now,\" he said. Angela Powell, 46, who drives a forklift in Ford\\'s electric vehicle assembly plant, could emerge as one of the winners in the new automotive landscape. \"To come from the old building and see the new vehicles, the state-of-the-art technology, it\\'s amazing,\" said Powell, who previously worked on the assembly line in Ford\\'s conventional truck plant. \"Who would have ever thought we would be here at this point? It\\'s an exciting time.\" Still, Powell worries about what will happen if the change is not managed well. If the government tries to effectively end the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, what happens if consumers don\\'t buy electric vehicles? What if they\\'re too expensive, or there aren\\'t enough charging stations, or supply chain disruptions slow down production? \"If this thing doesn\\'t go over right, will I have a job to come into the next day?\" she said. Another concern is that many of the new electric vehicle factories and battery plants are opening in Southeastern states such as Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee, where the political culture is historically hostile to organized labor, and wages and benefits are typically lower than in unionized plants. \"If you go to one of these startups or even a Ford plant where that isn\\'t a union job, you\\'re going to be making big sacrifices economically,\" Noffke said. A self-described \"car guy,\" Biden enjoys visiting automobile factories, including the Ford plant where Powell works and where Biden took the electric F-150 for a spin and declared: \"This sucker\\'s quick.\" Biden revels equally in his relationship with organized labor, calling himself the most pro-union of his predecessors. That connection to autoworkers helped Biden carry Michigan in 2020, after the state had supported Donald Trump in 2016. Labor\\'s support will be crucial if Biden runs again in 2024. Now, Biden is trying to maintain his standing with union workers at the same time he acts on climate change, an issue he has called a top priority. He has promised to cut the United States\\' greenhouse gas pollution at least 50% by 2030. A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency found that nations would have to stop selling new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to keep average global temperatures from increasing 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, the effects of catastrophic heat waves, flooding, drought, crop failures and species extinction become significantly harder for humanity to handle. The planet has already warmed an average of about 1.1 degrees Celsius. \"There\\'s a vision of the future that is now beginning to happen, a future of the automobile industry that is electric - battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, fuel-cell electric,\" Biden said in 2021 as he announced an executive order calling for federal policies to ensure that half of new cars sold were all-electric by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides up to $7,500 in tax credits for buyers of electric vehicles. But incentives alone won\\'t be enough to meet Biden\\'s climate targets, which is why new EPA regulations are needed, experts said. \"Nothing else ensures the transition to EVs at the pace we need to address global warming,\" said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. California, home to the nation\\'s largest auto market, has already passed a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035. Several officials working on the new federal regulation did similar climate work in California. But despite Biden\\'s commitment, a transition to an all-electric future carries political and economic risks. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich, whose district includes more than a dozen auto assembly plants as well as the EPA automotive lab, frequently reminds Ali Zaidi, a senior White House climate adviser, of the complexity of the situation. Zaidi speaks to Dingell so often that she is listed as simply \"DD\" in his cellphone. \"I\\'ve had real heart-to-heart conversations with the president and he does understand what these workers are afraid of,\" said Dingell, a former executive for General Motors. \"We have to make sure the policy underpinnings to be able to achieve something like this are there, without hurting people.\" Biden has worked to ensure that only American-made electric vehicles would qualify for tax incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act - although a requirement that they must be assembled by union workers was dropped. In 2022, Biden signed another law providing subsidies to companies to make their electric vehicle semiconductor chips in the United States. And in 2021, he signed an infrastructure law that includes $7.5 billion to build a half-million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways, although a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need millions more. \"There\\'s too much at stake not to get this right,\" Dingell said. \"But it\\'s a very difficult balance.\"', 'The choices facing Lionel Messi are these. He can sign on for another year, maybe two, locked in what seems to be a loveless but lucrative marriage of convenience with Paris St.-Germain. The downside is that he must endure the occasional indignity of hearing his name whistled and jeered and taken in vain. The upside is the chance to continue to play in - but if we are honest, not win - the Champions League. Option two: He could take the easy route, the smooth and seamless path that leads straight to the golden sunset. Al Hilal would very much like to pay him an eye-watering sum of money to turn the Saudi Premier League, in effect, into his and Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s very own Las Vegas residency. Cons: He would have to bid farewell to the (European) Champions League. Pros: $400 million a year. A third path, to Major League Soccer - and, more specifically, Inter Miami - can provide all of the same drawbacks and none of the same benefits. He would not earn nearly so much. He would still be absent from the club tournament he cherishes the most. He would have to be coached by Phil Neville. The pull of Miami, the lure of the United States and the prospect of the 2026 World Cup are appealing, but they may not be appealing enough. All of which, of course, leaves the road down which Messi\\'s heart would surely guide him. He never really wanted to leave Barcelona. He certainly did not want to leave the way he did, rushed out of the door by stark economic reality. Messi had spent his career deciding his own fate, only to have the nature of the end of it decided for him. The sense of unfinished business is mutual. \"I have a thorn in my side that Leo could not stay at our club,\" Rafa Yuste, Barcelona\\'s vice president, said last week. He wished, he said, that \"all of the conditions could come together so that this mutual love story ends with Messi at Barca. When you are in love and you separate from someone, you always want to stay in love.\" As overblown as that might sound, it would be churlish to dispute Yuste\\'s sincerity. Barcelona almost certainly sees some sort of sporting logic in bringing back Messi, of course. Correctly or not, the club genuinely believes that success is more likely with him than without: both directly, as a result of his performances, and indirectly, thanks to the boost to the brand that his presence would provide. But that does not mean the romantic impulse is not genuine. Barcelona has come to see Messi as a platonic ideal of its principles, the ones he was reared in from his days as a shy, homesick teenager at La Masia. Through its own colossal mismanagement, the club to which he devoted his career was not able to give Messi the goodbye it wanted or he deserved. It feels a duty to right the wrong. It would be naive, though, to believe that is the only motivation. Barcelona\\'s apparent fixation on the return of its king is powered by a swirl of emotions. Affection might be one of them, but so too is nostalgia, in its purest sense, an attachment not to who Messi is but to what he represents. Everything about the modern Barcelona screams that it has become a place obsessed by and addicted to reclaiming a past that still feels achingly real, overwhelmingly present. It is a club that could convincingly claim to be the biggest in the world barely a moment ago, the home of the finest side in history, and it is a club that continues to rage against its loss of status. So much of what Barcelona has done in recent years has been inspired by a refusal to acknowledge the ticking of the clock, the changing of the seasons. The pursuit of the European Super League, the appointment of Xavi Hernandez as manager, the mortgaging of its own future for immediate glory - this is the desperate, thrashing reflex of a club that assumed its primacy was the natural order of things, and does not understand why the world has been allowed to change. Restoring Messi to azulgrana would offer the opioid comfort of a step back in time. And then, rather more tangibly, there is political necessity, the projection of power. Barcelona is not owned by an individual; it is a members organization, one that functions, at least in theory, as a democracy. Joan Laporta, club president, will soon enough have to seek another mandate from the team\\'s 143,000 socios. Currently, he would have to stand for reelection as the president who lost Messi. He would much prefer, one would think, to be able to claim to be the man who returned him to where he belonged. After all, possessing Messi is more than having arguably the greatest player of all time in your ranks. His move to PSG, two years ago, proved that he is as much symbol as star. Messi represents relevance and importance, glamour and appeal. He would be a sign that the lean days had come to an end, of Barcelona\\'s resurgent virility. Most urgent of all, though, is the reputational benefit, not to Laporta as a president but to Barcelona as a club. Once as pristine a sporting brand as could be imagined, the sort of team that considered its jerseys so sacrosanct that it refused to despoil them with a sponsor, Barcelona has been wracked by scandal for years. The Super League was - and is, given its ongoing refusal to abandon the project - a bad look. The allegations that the club\\'s former administration hired a public relations company to boost its own reputation and to tarnish a number of players, executives and critics were not much better. Neither, though, was nearly as damaging as the charge, currently under investigation by both the Spanish judicial authorities and UEFA, European soccer\\'s governing body, that the club paid a former vice president of Spain\\'s refereeing committee about $7.6 million over the course of 17 years. Barcelona, of course, has insisted it has done nothing wrong: The club has suggested the stipend it is accused of paying the official, Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, between 2001 and 2018 was for perfectly ordinary \"technical reports into refereeing.\" It is, the club has intimated, the sort of thing everybody does. There is, we have been told, nothing to see here. That line has not been universally accepted. Javier Tebas, president of La Liga, has described the allegations as the \"worst reputational crisis\" Spanish soccer has ever seen. (Barcelona responded by calling on Tebas to resign.) Aleksander Ceferin, president of UEFA, has called it \"one of the most serious situations\" he has seen in soccer. Regardless of any potential sporting penalty, the reputational blowback - should Barcelona\\'s staunch defense not hold - would be indelible. It is hard to believe that it is a coincidence that Barcelona\\'s pursuit of Messi has become extremely public in that context. It is not just nation states, after all, that are in the business of using the game\\'s brightest stars to rehabilitate their reputations, to draw the eyes of the audience, to cast the unpalatable and the unpleasant firmly in deep shadow. Mere soccer teams can do it, too. Barcelona\\'s love for Messi is deep and it is sincere. But its need for him - as a symbol of power, as a reminder of what it once was, as a source of quick and easy dopamine, as a way of drawing the eye away from what it would rather you did not see - is greater still. He has four choices in front of him. They are, at heart, all the same. Barcelona wants to use him to clean its image just as surely as PSG wants to use him to prove its primacy and Al Hilal wants to use him to burnish a nation\\'s reputation and Inter Miami wants to use him to grow a league. There is no romance at the heart of any of them, none at all. It is business, just business and nothing more. Cold, Brutal and Entirely Irresistible Gary O\\'Neil\\'s career as a Premier League manager began, unexpectedly, in late August. His predecessor at Bournemouth, Scott Parker, had talked himself out of a job a few days earlier, using the occasion of a 9-0 defeat at Liverpool to explain, in great detail, exactly how little chance the club had of avoiding relegation. O\\'Neil was supposed to be what is now, by convention, called not a caretaker or a place-holder manager but an \"interim,\" a coach who will be replaced by a safer pair of hands as soon as one could be identified. But he did well, avoiding defeat in his first six games and slowly helping the team acclimatize to the Premier League. Quietly, perhaps a little reluctantly, Bournemouth made his appointment permanent during the World Cup. Gary O\\'Neil is now the 10th-longest-serving manager in the Premier League. There was a point, not so long ago, when it seemed English soccer had finally learned the benefits of patience. Clubs seemed to have internalized the idea that reflexively firing a coach at the first sign of trouble was not ideal from a long-term planning perspective. Just as significant, they were putting more thought into their appointments in the first place. That particular dam broke in the last two weeks of March. Crystal Palace firing Patrick Vieira, on the back of almost three months without a win, proved the decisive fissure. Between then and now, three more managers have gone. Leicester, now at grave risk of relegation, fired Brendan Rodgers. Antonio Conte committed dismissal-by-press-conference to get himself out of Tottenham. And, of course, Graham Potter met his inevitable, if accelerated, demise at Chelsea. None of those decisions were especially flagrant examples of the caprice of Premier League owners, of course, but the failures of both Conte and Potter probably say more about the people who appointed them than they do about the coaches themselves. Conte was handed a squad in need of a rebuild and tasked with winning immediately. Potter was placed in charge of a squad so large that the changing room at the training ground reportedly could not accommodate it - several players had to change on chairs brought in from elsewhere - and told to fashion a cogent team in only a few months. The ability to choose the right job, of course, is an invaluable part of the armory of any elite coach; Potter, still in the early stages of his career, will doubtless heed that lesson when he selects his next opportunity. But his failure at Chelsea, like that of Conte at Tottenham, is not solely his fault. He should not be allowed to become a scapegoat for those who made it impossible for him to succeed in the first place. After all, they are still in place. They are in charge, in fact, of choosing a replacement, with precious little evidence so far that they should be trusted to make the right selection.

This 44-year-old former corporate manager from Mysore who is the only child of his parents, has travelled with his mother around 66,000 kilometres in the last five years and have been to almost all the major religious cities across the country along with countries like Nepal, Bhutan, Manyamar etc. He had taken his 73-year-old mother Choodaratnamma on a pilgrimage and visited temples on a two- wheeler. \"I have been into this \\'Matru Seva Sankalpa Yatra\\' since January 16, 2018 because of a simple reason that my mother had been confined to four walls and a roof for her entire life, thus I wanted to show her the world\", said Kumar while talking to TOI on reaching Prayagraj. He would now be moving to Varanasi and after staying there at any ashram, temple or Math, mother-son duo would move to Bihar, visit some religious places and would go to visit Pashupatinath temple of Kathmandu. On being asked as to why has he chosen this old scooter in the era of fast moving trains and air conditioned coaches, the humble Kumar said, \"The scooter was given to me by my father (who served as a government employee in the forest department) when I completed my diploma back in 2001 and after his demise in the year 2015, I feel like my father\\'s presence along the journey\".  When on move, the duo covers around 100-150 km per day and do not follow any set timeline for reaching or leaving the religious city which they visit during their pilgrimage. \"Usually we travel for around 150 km on any travelling day and during the yatra, we have not confined ourselves with any set itinerary as I am doing this for my mother, so I move as per her wish\", said Kumar who stayed at Ramakrishna Mission here at Prayagraj. Dakshinmurthy Krishna Kumar. Their routine life too is very modest as the duo stay only in ashram or math and do not take a single penny from anyone and take simple vegetarian food just twice a day. They do not consume tea, coffee or any snacks in between. \"For the entire day, we take just lunch (around 11:00am) and dinner at around 8:00pm and in between we do not eat or drink anything and this keeps both of us healthy and fit\", said Kumar, who hails from Bogadi, Mysore, Karnataka. The road trips to holy cities and shrines have not always been comfortable. \"I still remember that both of us were stuck at Bhutan border for 52 days during the first lockdown because of Covid in 2020 and travelled for 427 km on a single day before covering a distance of 2,673 km in one week to reach Mysore\", recalls the dedicated unmarried son who supports this relentless pilgrimage from his savings.', 'Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) has cut the price of compressed natural gas (CNG) by Rs 6 per kg and that of piped natural gas (PNG) by Rs 5 per standard cubic meter (SCM) in Delhi.The new prices will be effective Sunday.

Cash-strapped Pakistan and the IMF have failed to reach a staff-level agreement on the much-needed USD 1.1 billion bailout package aimed at preventing the country from going bankrupt.  The funds are part of a USD 6.5 billion bailout package the IMF approved in 2019, which analysts say is critical if Pakistan is to avoid defaulting on external debt obligations.  The only hitch for the IMF deal to go through was the confirmation of a USD 1 billion commitment from a friendly country, Dar said in his address to the nation.  \"In the past two weeks, one of our friendly countries has again given them (the IMF) the confirmation [of its commitment to help Pakistan] with USD 2 billion.  \"We are now only awaiting the confirmation of a USD 1 billion commitment from one friendly country. After that, all their requirements to conclude the staff-level agreement will be complete. Following that, it takes two more weeks to take the matter into the board meeting,\" Dar said.  Though Dar did not name the countries, local media reports said Saudi Arabia had given the commitment to the IMF on helping Pakistan.  Dar was expected to attend the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF that are scheduled from April 10 to 16 in Washington.  He clarified that he had postponed his visit to the US due to the political situation in the country.  The finance minister acknowledged that there was a new development with the IMF deal over the past few weeks due to the \"cross-subsidy\" in the works regarding fuel prices.  \"When I went to the IMF with my delegation in October 2022, I invited them to Pakistan for the ninth review, which is technically the September 2022 review,\" he said.  Dar acknowledged that the nine-day review was \"the most difficult negotiations\" and it was concluded, which led to the government taking prior actions demanded by the IMF, including the imposition of new taxes worth Rs 170 billion.  In February this year, IMF officials and the Pakistan government held discussions, which remained inconclusive.  Pakistan, currently in the throes of a major economic crisis, is grappling with high external debt, a weak local currency and dwindling foreign exchange reserves enough to shore up for barely one month\\'s imports.  The consumer price inflation in Pakistan jumped to a record 35.37 per cent in March this year, as food, beverage and transport prices surged to an astonishing 50 per cent year-on-year.  At least 22 people have been killed in stampedes at government-sponsored food distribution outlets across the country.', 'Russia lost elections to three United Nations bodies this week, a sign that opposition to its invasion of Ukraine over a year ago remains strong. The votes in the 54-member U.N. Economic and Social Council follow approval of six non-binding resolutions against Russia by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. The latest - on Feb. 23, the eve of the first anniversary of the invasion - called for Moscow to end hostilities and withdraw its forces and was adopted by a vote of 141-7 with 32 abstentions. In the ECOSOC votes, Russia was overwhelmingly defeated by Romania for a seat on the Commission on the Status of Women. It lost to Estonia to be a member of the executive board of the U.N. children\\'s agency UNICEF. And it was defeated by Armenia and the Czech Republic in secret ballot votes for membership on the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after Wednesday\\'s votes, \"This is a clear signal from ECOSOC members that no country should hold positions on critical U.N. bodies when they are in flagrant violation of the U.N. Charter.\" In the voting for members of 14 commissions, boards and expert groups that ECOSOC oversees, Russia was elected to the Commission for Social Development by acclamation - which the United States and the United Kingdom dissociated their countries from, saying Russia\\'s invasion violates international law and Ukraine\\'s territorial integrity. Russia was also elected by acclamation to the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting, ', \"By now, you all must have become acquainted with all the buzz around ChatGPT and generative AI. Designed to understand and produce texts resembling a human response, this high-tech tool has already reached around 100 million active users. From writing essays, articles, poetry and paragraphs for you, to decoding and simplifying complex themes and equations, it does what it claims — ensuring impressively quick responses to all your queries.However, many educators have started resenting this tool’s acceptance in the education sector. They claim “it can hamper creative thinking and research skills of the students”. Plus, with more students potentially exploring this AI bot to write their assignments and at-home tests, teachers are struggling to rethink strategies to fight plagiarism.Having said that, what if we told you that there are numerous ways in which teachers can use ChatGPT to their benefit? Along with streamlining lesson plans, generating mind-boggling quizzes, and designing engaging activities, teachers can use this software to automate a wide range of their everyday tasks. So, if you are keen to find out how to integrate ChatGPT into your classroom, continue to read.How can teachers use ChatGPT in or outside the classroom?In India, excessive workload often leaves teachers overworked and sometimes even mentally exhausted. Besides, according to experts, a teacher spends around 7-8 hours daily in school, and only half of this time gets devoted to actual interaction with students. Often, they juggle responsibilities that can be easily automated with the integration of a tool like ChatGPT. So, why not do that? MORE STORIES FOR YOU✕Can AI replace jobs & surpass human mind? Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks up on the dangers of artificial intelligenceAI may change everything, but probably not too quicklyIs AI-enabled ChatGPT a boon or a bane for the edtech industry?« Back to recommendation storiesI don't want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMITListed below are some of the ways in which teachers can use this futuristic technology to their advantage:Planning lessons – With its ability to swiftly comprehend and follow your instructions, ChatGPT can assist in writing lesson plans. For instance, when asked to curate a lesson plan for Chinua Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart”, it came up with a well-structured answer detailing objectives, assignments, activities and discussions around the requested theme. This can make the whole teaching session immensely engaging. Moreover, you can even ask it to further tweak the plans generated by it according to the need. Simplifying complex topics – Sometimes it can be challenging for teachers to explain complex themes to students in the simplest way possible. This is where ChatGPT comes into play. On being asked to explain the concept of gravity to a fourth grader, the software responded: “Gravity is a force that pulls things towards each other. It makes things fall to the ground when you drop them. It also keeps planets moving around the Sun.” Easy to grasp, right?Managing professional communication – Another way to use this tool is to effectively communicate with parents, colleagues and students. Whether it’s about summarising student progress, sending out automated feedback reports, releasing donation and fee requests, or making newsletter copies, this chatbot can work exceptionally well as your personal writing assistant. To test it, we instructed the bot to prepare a note asking parents to send their students on a field trip to the Nehru Planetarium, and the result was surprisingly good.Assessing and evaluating assignments – ChatGPT can also be used for assessing and fixing the areas of improvement in assignments submitted by students. All you have to do is upload the copies and ask it to suggest improvements. If required, this trained bot can identify grammatical errors and suggest ways to rephrase the entire content. This feature can be really helpful for teachers who are required to evaluate 35-40 copies every single day. Supporting students with specific learning needs – By using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT can translate any content into languages such as French, Spanish and Italian. Similarly, it has been known to smartly cater to the needs of specially-abled students. According to reports, those with dyspraxia, ADHD, visual impairment and dyscalculia are able to understand and retain the content better with ChatGPT. Producing teaching aids – Besides providing lesson plans, ChatGPT is also capable of offering interactive teaching aids to boost student engagement. Depending on the subject matter, it can suggest a variety of teaching aids such as educational games, simulations, videos, animations, quizzes, slides and more. When we asked it to make an interactive video on the planets, it recommended both pre-made as well as completely new options. For creating a high-quality video, the bot demanded a delivery time of 5-7 hours.An ‘artificial’ edgeIn the coming years, ChatGPTand other generative AI tools could become an integral part of the modern education system. While teachers are right to display certain concerns about the accuracy of this tool, the impact on student learning and emerging privacy concerns, avoiding or banning it might not be the right decision. Students nowadays are surrounded by a range of AI technologies, and it is only natural for them to have the urge to test them. And who better than a teacher to end their curiosities and teach them the right way to use a tool like ChaGPT? By embracing it as a teaching aid, teachers can upskill themselves and enhance the learning experience for students. At the same time, they need to keep looking out for potential pitfalls and possible issues.\", 'UBS\\'s multi-billion state-sponsored takeover of Credit Suisse should proceed smoothly without political obstructions, Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said in an interview published on Saturday. The Swiss parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session next week to discuss the emergency merger engineered by the Swiss authorities after Credit Suisse came close to collapse. Nearly 260 billion Swiss francs ($287 billion) of liquidity support and state guarantees have been offered to back the takeover and avoid a financial meltdown the bank\\'s uncontrolled failure could have triggered. \"There is a merger agreement between UBS and CS, for its part the cabinet has made a commitment to the national bank to provide CS with liquidity in order to ensure stability,\" Keller-Sutter told newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft. \"The guarantee agreement with UBS is still being negotiated. In many committee meetings, I got the impression that politicians definitely don\\'t want to jeopardise the takeover,\" she added. \"I don\\'t see any stumbling blocks at the moment.\" Completing the merger was the highest priority, the minister said, who defended the government\\'s intervention last month, which critics have said came too late and promised too much taxpayer support for a bank that paid out billions in bonuses to executives. \"The primary goal of the Federal Council was to ensure the stability of the Swiss economy and the Swiss financial center and to prevent an international financial crisis,\" she said. \"Under the circumstances, it was and is the best possible choice, which also places the least burden on the state and the taxpayer,\" Keller-Sutter said. The new combined bank will have $1.6 trillion in assets - double the size of the entire Swiss economy - and more than 120,000 staff and Keller-Sutter said the structure of UBS would have to be considered in the future. \"UBS will have to hold more equity after the takeover. This will rather force them to shrink,\" Keller-Sutter said. Switzerland\\'s Competition Commission can also make recommendations, the minister added. The risks to the taxpayer were also acceptable - even though the government could assume up to 9 billion francs in losses incurred by UBS by the takeover. Keller-Sutter criticised the culture at Credit Suisse, which she said had set the wrong incentives and had not learned from previous scandals and prosecutions. The minister also defended the writedown of AT1 bonds to zero, a controversial part of the rescue. \"These are high-risk bonds with high yields, sometimes over 9%,\" Keller-Sutter said. \"The prospectus for these bonds makes it clear that if a company claims indirect government aid, they can be written off.\" The special parliamentary session next week was important, she added, and a welcome opportunity to get to the truth of the Credit Suisse debacle. \"At the moment, parliament can \\'only\\' advise on the commitment credit, but it also has the opportunity to comment on the case and play an active role in the process.\" ($1 = 0.9051 Swiss francs) ', 'Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) has reduced the price of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) by Rs 8.13 per kg and that of piped natural gas (PNG) by Rs 5.06 per standard cubic metre (scm).The revised prices came into effect on April 8 at midnight.The price revision came after the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved new guidelines on gas pricing, which paves the way for natural gas prices in India to be linked to global crude prices.\"In line with our policy to prioritize our end consumers, ATGL has decided to pass through the benefit of the New Gas Pricing guidelines announced by the Government of India to the large numbers of Home PNG and CNG consumers, thus enhancing the affordability of PNG and CNG with a saving of over 40% for CNG consumers as compared to Petrol prices and around 15% for Home PNG consumers as compared to LPG prices,\" the company said in a press statement.On Friday, Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas, slashed retail price of CNG by Rs 8 per kg and domestic PNG by Rs 5 per standard cubic metres across its licensed areas in Maharashtra.', 'Automaker GM\\'s self-driving car Cruise AV crashed into a city bus after its self-driving software failed to predict the movement of the vehicle. The company has now issued a voluntary recall to update the software in 300 robotaxis.This issue resulted in a single collision on March 23, 2023, in which a Cruise AV inaccurately predicted the movement of an articulated San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority (MUNI) bus.The Cruise self-driving software failed to accurately predict the movement of the bus and struck the back after \"decelerating too late to avoid a rear-end collision with the bus\".Kyle Vogt, Cruise Founder and CEO, said that \"fender benders like this rarely happen to our AVs, but this incident was unique.\"\"We do not expect our vehicles to run into the back of a city bus under any conditions, so even a single incident like this was worthy of immediate and careful study,\" he said in a statement.The company then filed a voluntary recall with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).\"Less than an hour after the collision, we had fully assembled a team to investigate what happened. We also moved quickly to brief our state and federal regulators on the incident and made our team available to answer any questions they had,\" said the CEO.Cruise said in the regulatory filing that the software recall was issued because of a \"rare circumstance\" in which the automated driving system caused the driverless robotaxi \"to hard brake while making an unprotected left turn.\"', 'Going big on the textile industry and its Make in India effort, the Indian government has planned to set up seven mega textile parks under PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel (PM MITRA) scheme. These parks will come up in seven states -- Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet stated that the parks would \"provide state-of-the-art infrastructure for the textiles sector, attract investment of crores and create lakhs of jobs\". The scheme was announced in October 2021, and the parks will be set up by 2026-27. The total outlay for the project is Rs 4,445 crore, though the initial allocation in the 2023-24 Budget is only Rs 200 crore. \"PM MITRA mega textile parks will boost the textiles sector in line with 5F (Farm to Fibre to Factory to Fashion to Foreign) vision,\" PM Modi tweeted. The Centre envisages an investment of nearly Rs 70,000 crores into these parks, with employment generation for about 20 lakh people, India\\'s Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal said. The parks will function as centres of opportunity to create an integrated textiles value chain, right from spinning, weaving, processing, dyeing and printing to garment manufacturing, all at a single location, reported The Hindu. \"The textile industry has been unorganised in the country. This increased wastage and logistical costs impacted the competitiveness of the country\\'s textile sector. This cluster-based approach, a vision of the Prime Minister, will solve several problems of the sector,\" Goyal said. He added that environmental clearances would also be eased under the scheme. Textiles Secretary Rachna Shah said that the Ministry had selected the locations for the parks in a transparent manner, having considered 18 proposals from 13 states. The eligibility of the states and sites was evaluated using a transparent challenge. It was based on objective criteria, taking into account a variety of factors such as connectivity, the existing ecosystem, textiles, industry policy, infrastructure, utility services, etc. PM Gati Shakti- National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity--was also used for validation, reported PM MITRA Parks represents a distinctive model in which the Central and State Governments will collaborate to boost investment, foster innovation, create job opportunities, and eventually turn India into a major hub for textile production and exports. Through these parks, an expenditure of almost 70,000 crores of rupees and the creation of 20 lakh jobs are anticipated. \"An SPV [Special Purpose Vehicle] owned by Centre and State Government will be set up for each park which will oversee the implementation of the project. The Ministry of Textiles will provide financial support in the form of Development Capital Support upto Rs 500 crore per park to the Park SPV,\" the Ministry said. A Competitive Incentive Support (CIS) of up to Rs 300 crore per park to the units in PM MITRA Park shall also be provided to incentivise speedy implementation. Convergence with other Government of India schemes shall also be facilitated in order to ensure additional incentives to the MasterDeveloper and investor units\" added the statement. Goyal said that State governments have offered to provide at least 1,000 acres of land for free for the parks and will also facilitate the provision of all utilities such as power and water. He said that Rs200 crores have been allotted as an initial investment. \"Different elements to make all the approvals easier will be considered. We will encourage the use of renewable energy in a big way in these parks,\" Goyal said, adding that the parks would offer excellent infrastructure, plug-and-play facilities as well as training and research facilities for the industry, reported The Hindu.', \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off Secunderabad-Tirupati Vande Bharat Express during his Telangana visit on Saturday.The redevelopment of Secunderabad Railway Station, at a cost of Rs 720 crore, will involve a major makeover with world-class amenities and an aesthetically designed iconic station building, reported ANI, citing the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).The redeveloped station would have a double-level spacious roof plaza with all passenger amenities in one place along with multimodal connectivity for providing seamless transfer of passengers from rail to other modes among others, read a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).He will flag off Secunderabad-Tirupati Vande Bharat Express at Secunderabad Railway Station.The Secunderabad-Tirupati Vande Bharat Express, connecting IT City, Hyderabad with the Abode of Lord Venkateswara, Tirupati, is the second Vande Bharat train to be started from Telangana within a short span of three months.

The Madhya Pradesh shuttler, who was part of the Indian team that registered an epic win at the 2022 Thomas Cup, saw off world number 49 Johannesen 21-15 19-21 21-16 in a 68-minute summit clash to grab the biggest title of his career.  \"I am very happy with my performance this week. It is my first big title and I\\'m extremely happy to win this,\" world no. 58 Rajawat, who is likely to get into top 40 after this win, told PTI from Orleans.  The two shuttlers, making it to the final after coming through the qualifiers, dished out some superb badminton, but the Indian rode on his ability to produce winners to secure the world tour super 300 crown.  It was the first meeting between the two 21-year-olds, both looking for a breakthrough win but Rajawat, who didn\\'t drop a game in the USD 240,000 tournament, showed his maturity as he dished out a controlled aggressive game to come up trumps.  The image of an airborne Rajawat unleashing a forehand crosscourt jump smash to trouble his opponent will be etched in the mind of the spectators, as he accumulated multiple points with this trademark shot.  A year ago, Rajawat had returned early from Orleans when it was a super 100 event, but the tournament was upgraded to super 300 from this year, and the Indian made the most of the opportunity.  Rajawat, who picked up the sport as a six-year-old, dished out his range of strokes to move to 6-5 with two aggressive returns on the left-handed Dane\\'s backhand. A backhand smash and another winner saw him lead 11-8 at the interval.  The Indian showed great anticipation, which allowed him to get into position early and bring down the shuttle with a thwack. Two cross-court smashes helped the Indian create a yawning gap at 18-11, which the Dane couldn\\'t bridge.  After the change of sides, Johannesen strengthened his defence while Rajawat botched up some of his shots to allow the Dane lead 6-3 as he went into the break with a three-point cushion this time.  Rajawat fell into a pool of errors to allow the Dane increase the gap to 14-9. He clawed back at 17-15, producing some accurate winners but Johannesen jumped to three game points.  The Indian saved two before conceding one at the net as the Dane took the match to the decider.  In the third game, Rajawat zoomed to 7-2 after producing a series of winners but Johannesen narrowed it down to 7-8 after winning an incredible 54-shot rally. The Dane drew parity at 9-9 but the Indian managed to gain a small two-point cushion after producing two winners.  After the final changeover, Rajawat got a second wind as he extended his lead to four points after winning another superb rally. He kept the rallies in his firm grip and soon grabbed seven championship points with another cross-court smash.  He converted on his fourth attempt and lifted his hand in celebration.  \"In the second game I was little tired and ended up making mistakes. My coach (N Anil Kumar) told me not to think too much and just keep the shuttle inside the court,\" Rajawat said.  \"I recovered from 9-14 down but a small mistake cost me the second game. In the third game, I was able to keep the mistakes low. I knew if I can keep it simple, he will give me points.\"  Rajawat\\'s growing up years and influences  =========================  Rajawat started playing the game following his brother Krunal. He was interested in football for a brief time but then badminton took over and soon he found himself in the Pullela Gopichand Academy in Gwalior.  \"I was there for two years but then Gopi sir called me to Hyderabad and I have been training there since 8 year old,\" said Rajawat.  In Hyderabad, Rajawat had the fortune of watching the cream of Indian badminton in action. Be it Kidambi Srikanth or HS Prannoy, training with them shaped his game.  \"I grew up watching videos of Lin Dan and Gopi sir and then when I started training, there was Srikanth bhaiyya, Sameer bhaiyya, Prannoy bhaiyya, all of them had an influence on my game. The sessions I had with them helped me immensely and their success also motivated me a lot.\"  Rajawat, who had a runner-up finish at Odisha Open in 2022, won the BAI trials to make it to the Thomas Cup team. He then won the Raipur International Challenge and finished second at Bangladesh Open in December.', 'Legendary theatre actor Jalabala Vaidya is no more.

Sibal, a prominent voice in the Opposition ranks, gave a clarion call to all political parties opposed to the BJP-led government to first find a common platform which, he said, could also be his newly-launched \\'Insaaf\\' platform for fighting injustice.  In an interview with PTI, the former Union minister said the leadership question of an Opposition coalition for 2024 need not be answered at this stage and also cited the example of 2004 when the incumbent Atal Bihari Vajpayee dispensation was voted out of power despite the Opposition not having a declared face.  He asserted that the Congress certainly has to be the fulcrum and at the centre of any coalition of Opposition parties that will take on the BJP in 2024.  Asked if Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar\\'s statement backing the Adani Group which is facing certain allegations jolted the Opposition unity, Sibal said, \"If you narrow down issues then you will have differences among political parties. If you have a broad collaborative platform which does not deal with narrow issues, the possibility of consensus is much greater.\"  \"If Rahul Gandhi has a point of view in the context of crony capitalism in India, I think Sharad Pawar ji would not be averse to a platform relating to crony capitalism, that subsumes individuals. So what we need is to have these broad platforms on the basis of which we can ensure that the Opposition is united,\" he said.  He said the moment issues are narrowed down problems arise and gave the example of parties having different points of view on a particular legislation.  \"You should allow different parties to have different views. We should allow Rahul Gandhi to have a view on an individual and Sharad Pawar also have his point of view. That should not be an example of disunity,\" said Sibal, who was a Union minister during UPA 1 and 2, and quit the Congress in May last year.  Sibal, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha as an Independent member with the Samajwadi Party\\'s support, recently floated a non-electoral platform \\'Insaaf\\' aimed at fighting injustice.  \"Opposition unity will come about only when we have a broad consensus and a platform that elucidates broad issues of that consensus,\" he said.  Sibal said his message to Opposition parties would be that the bottom line is that great injustices - social, economic and political - are being perpetrated in this country by the diktats of this government.  \"In fact the entire Constitution is a narrative of how to achieve justice. So, the fight against injustice can be a common platform,\" he said.  On whether his newly floated platform could provide what the Opposition needs, Sibal said \"could be\", but added that a lot of work needs to be done to bring all political parties on that platform.  Asked if it was practical that the Opposition parties of diverse backgrounds come together and cede parliamentary seats to each other to take on the BJP jointly in 2024, Sibal said parties have to be more generous, more circumspect in criticising each other\\'s ideologies and have to realise that wherever they are weak, they should allow the dominant partner to have a say.  On the strengthened Opposition unity during the second half of the budget session of Parliament, especially after the disqualification of Rahul Gandhi from Lok Sabha, Sibal said as far as the joint protests in Parliament are concerned, that by itself is not a reflection of Opposition unity.  \"As far as Opposition unity is concerned this is the first step. We need political parties to be more generous to each other and allow space for each other to have their own ideological moorings but at the same time get together to fight a government which is hell bent on silencing the people of India and converting this so-called democracy into an autocratic country,\" he said.  Sibal said that having a common minimum programme for a united Opposition was a \"tall order\" and it would be decided only a few months before the general elections.  On whether the Adani issue and the caste census be the main planks for the Opposition going forward towards 2024, Sibal said he cannot suggest that as he is just an independent member of Parliament.  \"I think the caste census issue is a big issue. It is a big issue in many states, in particular northern India, but whether that will be a unifying factor or whether that will be projected as a national issue, I cannot possibly say,\" he added.  On the Adani matter, Sibal said the issue is not about A, B or C, it is how the state and big conglomerates are collaborating with each other to control resources, media, centres of power and along with that the central agencies.  Rebutting Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s charge that the Opposition is coming together as they are afraid of his government\\'s anti-corruption crusade, he asked if the Centre was so concerned about graft why did it not appoint a Lokpal for five years after coming to power.  Why has the Lokpal been inactive and not investigated anybody in government, he asked.  \"Is it the premise of our dear prime minister that nobody in government in any BJP-ruled states and in the central government can ever be charged for corruption, and that each one of them is as white as snow,\" Sibal asked.  He also questioned the prime minister as to why ongoing investigations against those joining the BJP stopped.  \"Why is it that the map of India has been divided into two parts, wherever there are BJP-ruled states, the CBI has no access to, while in the Opposition-ruled states, they have complete access,\" Sibal said.  This narrative of the prime minister is based on a weak premise, he asserted.  Asked about several Congress leaders quitting the party to join the ideologically opposite BJP, Sibal said that is why he has been calling for an amendment to the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution which deals with the issue of defection.  \"Anybody who in the midst of a term of Parliament seeks to leave (a party) and join another party for greener pastures should not be allowed to hold a public post for five years or fight an election,\" he said.', 'Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday said he will file a defamation case against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over a tweet that linked him to the Adani group. Addressing a press conference here, Sarma said the defamation case will be filed after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\'s visit to Guwahati on April 14. \"Whatever Rahul Gandhi tweeted, it\\'s defamatory. We will respond after the PM leaves the state,\" he said. \"Definitely, a defamation case will be filed in Guwahati,\" he added. Gandhi on Saturday took a swipe at some leaders who have quit the Congress in recent years and some of whom have joined the BJP as he kept up his offensive against the government over the Adani issue. \"They hide the truth, that\\'s why they mislead everyday! The question remains the same - whose Rs 20,000 crore benami money is in Adani\\'s companies?\" Gandhi asked in a tweet in Hindi, sharing an image with \\'Adani\\' written as an acronym of sorts with letters of the names of the leaders. He cited the names of Ghulam Nabi Azad, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kiran Kumar Reddy and Anil K Antony in his tweet. After quitting the Congress, Azad formed his own party, while the rest joined the BJP. Scindia is now a Union minister and Sarma the chief minister of Assam. Quoting Gandhi\\'s tweet, Sarma had earlier tweeted, \"It was our decency to have never asked you, on where have you concealed the proceeds of crime from the Bofors and National Herald Scams. And how you allowed Ottavio Quattrocchi to escape the clutches of Indian justice multiple times.

Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya will visit AIIMS, Jhajjar on April 10 to oversee the mock drill, officials said on Sunday. In a review meeting held on April 7, Mandaviya had urged state health ministers to visit hospitals and oversee the mock drills. He had also advised them to review the preparedness with district administrations and health officials on April 8 and 9. In the meeting with state health ministers, and principal and additional chief secretaries held virtually, Mandaviya had stressed the need to identify emergency hotspots by monitoring trends of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases, ramping up testing and vaccination, and ensuring readiness of hospital infrastructure. Besides enhancing genome sequencing and ramping up whole genome sequencing of positive samples, he had emphasised creating awareness about following Covid-appropriate behaviour. During the meeting, states and union territories were informed that currently the World Health Organisation (WHO) is closely tracking a variant of interest (VOI), XBB.1.5, and six other variants are under monitoring (BQ.1, BA.2.75, CH.1.1, XBB, XBF and XBB.1.16), a health ministry statement had said. It was highlighted that while Omicron and its sub-lineages continue to be the predominant variants, most of the assigned variants have little or no significant transmissibility, disease severity or immune escape. The prevalence of XBB.1.16 increased from 21.6 per cent in February to 35.8 per cent in March. However, no evidence of an increase in hospitalisation or mortality has been reported, the statement said. During the meeting, it was observed that 23 states and union territories had average tests per million below the national average. Mandaviya had said that irrespective of the new variants, the five-fold strategy of 'Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and adherence to Covid-Appropriate Behaviour' continues to remain the tested strategy for Covid management. States and union territories were also requested to expeditiously increase the rate of testing from 100 tests per million as on the week ending April 7. They were further advised to increase the share of RT-PCR in tests.\", 'Credit growth continued to outpace deposit growth in FY\\'23 at an eleven year high even as banks have transmitted fully -250 bps - their lending rates linked to external benchmarks which now comprise almost half of floating rate loans.

', 'Twitter and social media platform Discord have various policies that might have prompted them to remove the leaked Pentagon documents that Biden administration officials say revealed key information about U.S. intelligence gathering operations. But gray areas in those rules and uneven enforcement of them make it unclear how, or even if, executives at those companies would decide to remove them. As of Saturday, Twitter continued to host tweets with the Pentagon\\'s documents, some of which had been up since at least Wednesday. There is no indication that Elon Musk, who bought Twitter nearly six months ago, will take any action against the tweets with the classified documents. Two days earlier, Musk seemed to respond sarcastically to a tweet about the leaked material. \"Yeah, you can totally delete things from the Internet - that works perfectly and doesn\\'t draw attention to whatever you were trying to hide at all,\" he wrote. On Discord, which is a messaging platform popular with video game players, the Pentagon documents may have been circulating as early as March. Since Discord chat groups - known as servers - are not directly managed by the company as a Facebook or Twitter feed is, the distribution of the Pentagon documents would have been difficult to spot. Musk did not respond to a request for comment Saturday, and Discord declined to comment. It is not known if the companies, which are both based in the United States, have been asked to remove the Pentagon material.Discover the stories of your interestBlockchain5 StoriesCyber-safety7 StoriesFintech9 StoriesE-comm9 StoriesML8 StoriesEdtech6 Stories In the past, Twitter may have removed the material under rules that prohibit the publication and distribution of hacked materials, two former executives told The New York Times. Under this policy, Twitter would remove tweets with \"real or synthesized hacked materials\" or place warning labels on the material. Some of the Pentagon material circulating on social media may have been manipulated. But there were caveats to Twitter\\'s rules, as they were described in a policy document, which was last updated in October 2020. The rules allowed for exceptions for material that forms the basis for reporting by news agencies. And debates inside social media companies about what to allow online have often been similar to discussions that traditional media have about whether leaked or hacked material is of enough public interest to justify publishing. It was not clear Saturday whether the Pentagon material was hacked or intentionally leaked - the images circulating appeared to be photographs of documents. The documents could fall into a gray area that, at least in the past, would have led to discussion among compliance officers inside the company about whether they qualified for a takedown. Twitter used its hacked-material policy to block the circulation of an article in October 2020 from the New York Post that said the FBI had seized a computer that purportedly belonged to Joe Biden\\'s son Hunter. Twitter\\'s leaders, including then-CEO Jack Dorsey, later called the decision a mistake. The former executives, who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from Musk, said Twitter often received reports of potential violations of its polices from U.S. government organizations. But since acquiring the company in October, Musk has shrunk the groups responsible for moderation and more than 75% of Twitter\\'s 7,500 employees have been fired or have left. Ella Irwin, Twitter\\'s head of trust and safety, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Twitter has removed or prevented the circulation of content at the behest of governments such as India and on Musk\\'s whims. This past week, Twitter also began regulating the circulation and engagement of links to Substack, a newsletter platform, after the startup unveiled a Twitter-like service. On Friday, many Substack writers found that tweets that had links to their Substack pages could not be liked or retweeted. Discord surged in popularity during the pandemic, moving beyond its video game roots. By late 2021, the platform had more than 150 million active users each month. Discord provides so-called servers that are essentially chatrooms, where people can discuss their hobbies and message with one another or join audio calls. Some servers are public and contain thousands of people, while others - such as servers made just for a group of friends - are private. This arrangement has enabled Discord to thrive but has also led to problems with harmful content. Ensuring that Discord users follow the platform\\'s policies and refrain from posting inappropriate or questionable material has largely been left up to the individuals who create the servers, some of whom deputize members of the server communities to help enforce rules. The private nature of some of these groups means they can easily escape detection or moderation. In 2017, white nationalists organized the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on far-right Discord servers. Company executives were aware the white nationalists were using the platform but did not remove them until after the rally. Discord said it had since beefed up its content-moderation team, and the company\\'s CEO, Jason Citron, said in a 2021 interview that 15% of his employees worked on trust and safety teams. Still, the company did not discover Discord messages in a private server posted by the shooter who killed 10 people at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, last spring. In the messages, the shooter posted racist remarks and appeared to detail how he planned to carry out the attack. After the shooting, Discord said it was investigating the postings and working with law enforcement agencies. In its most recent transparency report, covering the last three months of 2022, Discord said it had disabled more than 150,000 accounts for policy violations that ranged from \"harassment and bullying\" to \"exploitative and unsolicited content.\" The number of accounts it had disabled was a 17% decrease from the three months before that, the company said.

Alleging that the State\\'s milk production had been affected since the day Union Cooperative Minister Amit Shah spoke about the possibility of merging the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) with Amul, the former Chief Minister in a series of tweets asked the Prime Minister what his role had been in this. Amul\\'s move is being seen by many, especially opposition parties, as a threat to KMF\\'s famed dairy brand \\'Nandini\\'. They also see it as an attempt to trample upon KMF, amid a narrative around its merger with Amul. \"Is your purpose of coming to Karnataka to give to Karnataka or to loot from Karnataka? You have already stolen banks, ports and airports from Kannadigas. Are you now trying to steal Nandini (KMF) from us?\" Siddaramaiah asked. \"It was Gujarat\\'s Baroda Bank that subsumed our Vijaya Bank. Ports and Airports were handed over to Gujarat\\'s Adani. Now, Amul from Gujarat is planning to eat our KMF (Nandini). Mr Narendra Modi, Are we the enemies for Gujaratis?\" Instead of giving 2 crore jobs a year to youths, Narendra Modi took away the jobs of Kannadigas from our banks, ports and airports, he further said, adding that \"Now Karnataka BJP wants to hurt the prospects of our farmers by giving KMF to Amul.\" Modi was in Mysuru and Chamarajanagara districts to attend an event commemorating 50 years of \\'Project Tiger\\'. The attacks from Siddaramaiah came despite Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday clarifying in this regard. Calling \\'Nandini\\' the pride of Karnataka, and stating that his government had taken all kinds of measures to make it number one at the national level, Bommai said, \"Nandini\\'s market reach is wide, there is no need to fear Amul.\" Congress politicising everything is not in the interest of the state, he had said. \"We are also going to other states and marketing....we will do all that is required to put Amul behind in the competition.\" State Cooperation Minister S T Somashekar on Sunday reiterated that there was no proposal to merge KMF with Amul. \"If Amul sells milk online at Rs 57 per litre, we sell it at Rs 39. We are sending our products to Tamil Nadu and other states,\" he said, adding that it was impossible to erase the Nandini brand. State BJP General Secretary C N Ashwathnarayan criticised former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah of Congress and H D Kumaraswamy of JDS for making \"irresponsible statements\" on the issue. Stating that it was clear that Amul was trying to indulge in unnecessary competition with KMF and was planning to trample Nandini day by day, Kumaraswamy had said \"Unhealthy competition between well-known sister organisations in the cooperative sector is not in anyone\\'s interest. KMF directly buys milk from farmers through cooperative societies in thousands of villages in the state.\"', \"Police have booked gangster-turned-politician Atiq Ahmad, his wife Shaista Parveen and son Ali in a forgery case linked to the murder of Umesh Pal, the key witness in the murder case of BSP MLA Raju Pal.

The researchers, among them a scholar from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), discovered that a powerful electric field present at the boundary between airborne water droplets and the surrounding air can produce OH through a previously undiscovered process.According to Sergey Nizkorodov, a professor of chemistry at UCI, the presence of OH is essential to oxidize hydrocarbons and prevent them from accumulating in the atmosphere.Christian George, the lead author of the study and an atmospheric chemist at the University of Lyon in France, added that OH triggers reactions that decompose airborne pollutants and eliminates harmful chemicals like sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide from the atmosphere.These are the 10 most welcoming cities on Earth in 2023Autoplay1 of 11These are the 10 most welcoming cities on Earth in 2023Polignano a Mare, ItalyAccording to a list recently published by online travel agency Booking.com, Polignano a Mare located on the Adriatic Sea in Italy has topped the list of the \\'Most Welcoming Cities on Earth\\'.

As a significant participant in atmospheric chemistry, understanding the sources and sinks of OH is crucial in reducing air pollution. Sergey Nizkorodov noted that it is widely believed that OH is generated via photochemistry or redox chemistry, requiring sunlight or metal catalysts. However, the current study challenges this assumption. This research builds on previous findings by Stanford University scientists, who reported the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide on water droplet surfaces.

CCPS helps promoters to raise funds without diluting the ownership immediately.Therefore, the promoter Aavishkaar Group, which holds about 33% in Arohan, would continue to retain its holding without any dilution for about a year until conversion or any new fundraise. “The conversion will take place after a new priced round latest by March 2024” Nambiar said.This is Arohan’s second equity raise after the pandemic. It had mobilised Rs 168 crore in February 2021.The MFI with Rs 5,357 crore assets under management at the end of March plans to enter Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra this year, besides expanding its footprint in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The lender has 835 branches across 15 states.“We would look at acquisition opportunities especially in new geographies,” Nambiar said.With this fundraising, the micro loan lender expects to cross Rs 10,000 crore of AUM by March 2025 and expects to renew initial public offer (IPO) plan over the next 24 months.The lender had been contemplating an IPO since 2019. It had received approval for IPO in April 2021 but had to abort the plan due to a volatile market.According to people who follow the microfinance sector closely, the asset quality stress was another reason as to why several micro lenders including small finance banks had received tepid response and lower-than-expected valuation for their proposed IPOs, prompting them to shelve their plans eventually.Arohan has written-off Rs 380 crore of bad loans in FY23, helping it to reduce gross non-performing assets to below 3% at the end of March, Nambiar said.Net NPA would be 0.25%, he said.“As a business, we have always taken an additional overlay on provisions and will seek to be a net zero NPA company soon,” he added.The company developed its own credit scoring model with a credit bureau database to implement risk-based pricing. It offers loans to women in rural and semi-urban localities under the joint liability of lenders model at interest rates ranging from 23% to 26%, based on borrowers’ risk profile.\"We are now future ready with our digital lending offering called Arohan Privilege.

The ultimate aim of good governance is to bring ease of living to the citizens, he said while speaking as Chief Guest after presenting Yashraj Bharati Samman (YBS) Awards at a 'Gratitude ceremony'.The Minister recalled that soon after the government came to power in May 2014, within two to three months, the practice of getting certificates attested by gazetted officers was done away with. Thereafter within a year, the Prime Minister spoke from the ramparts of Red Fort about the abolition of interview in job recruitment so that a level playing field could be provided. In pensions, face recognition technology was introduced so that the elderly citizens did not have to go through the tedious process of getting a life certificate. Most of the functioning was converted online and in order to bring in transparency, accountability and citizen participation, the human interface was reduced to the bare minimum.Talking about grievance redressal, Jitendra Singh said that the grievance redressal mechanism was shifted to CPGRAMS as a result of which about 20 lakh grievances are received every year in comparison to just two lakhs every year before this government came in because this government followed a policy of time bound redressal and gained the confidence of the people.In the field of healthcare, the Minister said that the use of technology and telemedicine during Covid pandemic has shown how innovation can deliver healthcare in the remote and rural areas.This government has not only promoted technology and innovation but also Startups to undertake new innovations even in the health sector thereby transforming lives of citizens.\", 'April 10 is observed as World Homeopathy Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy. On this day, practitioners, enthusiasts, and supporters of homeopathy worldwide come together to raise awareness about this alternative system of medicine.Homeopathy is a holistic approach to healing that involves using highly diluted substances to stimulate the body\\'s natural healing processes. It was developed in the late 18th century by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician who was dissatisfied with the harmful side effects of the conventional medical practices of his time.The theme of the World Homeopathy Day 2023The theme of World Homeopathy Day 2023 is Homoeoparivar – Sarvajan Swasthya is “One Health, One Family\". This theme highlights the importance of homeopathy in promoting the health and well-being of the entire family and community. It emphasizes the holistic approach of homeopathy, which recognizes the interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and environmental health.Significance of the World Homeopathy DayHomeopathy has been found to be effective in treating a wide range of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, and OCD. Homeopathic remedies are safe, non-toxic, and free of side effects, making them an attractive alternative to conventional psychiatric medication, which often comes with a range of unpleasant side effects.The importance of World Homeopathy Day lies in its ability to raise awareness about the benefits of homeopathy and dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding this alternative system of medicine. Despite its proven efficacy, homeopathy has often been criticized as being unscientific and ineffective. World Homeopathy Day provides an opportunity to educate people about the scientific basis of homeopathy and the research that has been conducted to support its efficacy.Homeopathy is also an eco-friendly and sustainable form of medicine, as it involves using natural substances that are renewable and do not harm the environment. This aspect of homeopathy is particularly important in the current global climate crisis, where sustainability and environmental conservation have become urgent priorities.FAQsWhat is homeopathy?Homeopathy is a holistic approach to healing that involves using highly diluted substances to stimulate the body\\'s natural healing processes.Is homeopathy effective?Homeopathy has been found to be effective in treating a wide range of health issues, including mental health conditions, allergies, and chronic pain.', 'Adani Power Limited (APL), the largest private thermal power producer in India, has commissioned its first 800 MW ultra-super-critical thermal power generation unit at Godda in the Jharkhand district and begun supplying 748 MW of power to neighbouring Bangladesh, the company said today.“The Godda power plant is a strategic asset in the India-Bangladesh’s long-standing relationship,” said SB Khyalia, CEO, Adani Power Limited, adding that the power plant will ease power supply in Bangladesh, making its industries and ecosystem more competitive.\"It is going to be the most efficient and environment-friendly thermal power plant installed in India and the entire South-East region and also one of the best in class in the world,\" he said.The Godda Power Plant comprises two units of the latest technology available in the world, which is ultra super critical technology with latest techniques for controlling emissions and consumption of coal and water.The company added that it is the first power plant in the country, which has started its operations with 100% flue gas desulphurization (FGD), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and zero water discharge.The FGD and SCR have been installed in the plant to minimise the emission and meet the latest environment norms of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.In November 2017, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) executed a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with APL’s wholly-owned subsidiary Adani Power Jharkhand Limited (APJL) to procure 1,496 MW net capacity power from 2X800 MW ultra-supercritical power project at Godda. India’s largest power producer in the private sector is expected to commission its second 800 MW unit soon.Bangladesh has one of the largest liquid fuel-based power generation plants in the Indian sub-continent region. The installed capacity of heavy fuel oil (HFO)-based plants is about 6,329 MW and high-speed diesel (HSD)-based plants is about 1,290 MW, totaling to over 7,600 MW.As per BPDB’s annual report for the financial year 2021-22, the total tariff of HFO-based plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 22.10/kWh and total tariff of HSD-based power plants is around Bangladeshi Taka 154.11/kWh, which is far higher than the tariff of Godda Power Plant (Energy cost estimated to be around 9 cents/KWh). Though at present, Bangladesh has long-term PPA ties with three other imported coal-based generators, total tariff of Godda TPP is competitive compared to peers, the company said.APJL had synchronised the first unit with the power grid of Bangladesh on 29 November 2022 through a dedicated transmission line from Godda to Bangladesh.Subsequently, the requisite transmission evacuation system on the Bangladesh side was commissioned in March 2023. Accordingly, APJL again synchronised unit 1 on 20 March 2023. The Reliability Run Test, including Commercial Operation Tests, was completed on 5 April 2023 in the presence of authorities from BPDB and Power Grid Corporation of Bangladesh (PGCB) officials.Adani Power has an installed thermal power capacity of 13,610 MW spread across seven power plants in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh, apart from a 40 MW solar power plant in Gujarat.', \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the country’s total tiger population at 3,167, at an event in Mysuru, commemorating 50 years of Project tiger on Sunday in poll-bound Karnataka. Modi undertook a 20-km long safari in Bandipur Tiger reserve in Mysuru, and released the summary report of the 5th cycle of the All India Tiger Estimation. “We have added about 200 tigers to our forest in the last five years…we are expanding our tiger family,” he said, calling the success of Project Tiger a matter of pride, not just for India, but for the entire world.“We finished 75 years of independence and now we have 75% of the world’s tiger population. Coincidentally, we also have 75,000 sq. km of tiger reserves, and we have increased the tiger population by 75% in the last 10-12 years,” he added.The Prime Minister lauded India’s spirit of protectiveness and conservatism, attributing the success of Project Tiger to “sabka prayas” (everyone’s efforts). “With only 2.5% of the world’s area, we contribute around 8% of the world’s biodiversity. We do not assume conflict between ecology and economy, we promote coexistence,” he said.Modi also launched the International Big Cats Alliance (IBCA), to mobilize financial and technical resources, while learning from the conservation experiences of various countries. The IBCA will focus on conserving seven major big cats of the world - tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah. Countries that are home to these cats will be a part of this alliance. “Together we will save these species from extinction, and create a safe and healthy ecosystem,” he said.Cheetahs had become extinct in India in 1952 from hunting and loss of habitat. Modi highlighted his government’s achievement of carrying out a successful trans-continental relocation, bringing cheetahs to India from Namibia and South Africa. “Four beautiful cheetah cubs have been born in Kuno National Park a few days ago…cheetahs have been produced here after decades” he said.Recollecting Gujarat’s efforts to conserve lions in the Gir forest, the PM talked about the state’s Wildlife Mitra program. “We need to create a relationship of emotion as well as of economy between the local people and the animal,” Modi said. The Gir wildlife sanctuary is the only home for Asiatic lions in the world.

Elon Musk's automaker will break ground on the plant in the third quarter and start production in the second quarter of 2024, Xinhua reported from a signing ceremony in Shanghai. Complementing a huge existing Shanghai plant making electric vehicles, the new factory will initially produce 10,000 Megapack units a year, equal to around 40 gigawatt hours of energy storage, to be sold globally, Xinhua said. With the new Shanghai plant, Tesla will take advantage of China's world leading battery supply chain to ramp up output and lower costs of its Megapack lithium-ion battery units to meet rising demand of energy storage globally as the world shifts to use more renewable energy. Tesla generates most of its money from its electric car business, but Musk has committed to grow its solar energy and battery business to roughly the same size. Chinese battery giant CATL has also been deepening its collaborations with clients including Tesla in energy storage battery supplies, which its Chairman Robin Zeng expected to have a larger market than batteries powering electric vehicles (EV). Tesla currently has a Megafactory in Lathrop, California, capable of manufacturing 10,000 Megapacks per year. The company began producing Model 3 cars in Shanghai in 2019 and now is capable of producing 22,000 units of cars per week. Tesla planned to expand the Gigafactory Shanghai, its most productive automaking plant, to add an annual capacity of 450,000 units, Reuters reported last May. The U.S. company, however, had grappled with rising inventory in Shanghai as demand started weakening in the third quarter, leading to aggressive price cuts in its major markets globally in January. EV sales growth in China, the world's largest auto market, has slowed to 20.8% in the first two months of 2023, from 150% in the same period a year ago. \", 'Former union minister Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said people in Karnataka were tired of \"40 per cent commission\" and wanted \"100 per cent commitment\" that the Congress party would give if it were voted to power in the upcoming Assembly election. He also said that the Congress was prepared to tackle the \"serious deficiencies\" in state-level and urban-level governance in Bengaluru and the entire state of Karnataka. \"I think the people in this state are tired of the 40 per cent commission. What they want is 100 per cent commitment and that\\'s what we will give - 100 per cent commitment to the well-being of the people of Karnataka,\" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said at a press conference here. In poll-bound Karnataka where the Assembly election is just a month away, the Congress has been accusing the BJP-led state government of collecting 40 per cent commission from contractors, unaided private schools and even some religious institutions on the grants that they receive from the government. Tharoor said the state was being badly governed and that the infrastructure in Bengaluru was becoming an embarrassment. \"Our message is very simple. We have seen, unfortunately, over four years now, bad governance. When there is bad governance and there is nothing to see, people inevitably wonder what they need a government for,\" Tharoor said. There were essential needs of the people that had not been met and the Congress party had already come out with a number of \"very specific policies\" to fulfill those needs, the Congress leader said. He added that the Congress was coming up with policies such as ensuring that unemployed graduates and unemployed diploma-holders could get some support from the State so that they can live with self-respect while they search for jobs. He also said the Congress was planning to honour the \\'Gruha Lakshmi\\' -- the homemakers -- so that they could get some compensation for their unpaid labour. Tharoor said the Congress \"is pledging to improve the infrastructure of Bengaluru which used to be the pride of Karnataka and India but which is now becoming an embarrassment.\" \"So whether it is state-level governance or urban level governance, we feel that there are serious deficiencies that the Congress government is ready and prepared to tackle,\" the Congress MP said. To a question on some Congress leaders joining the BJP, he pointed out that several MLAs and MLCs too had joined the Congress from other parties in the past few months. \"Well if you look at the Karnataka situation, five MLAs, two MLCs, 11 former MLAs, four former MLCs and one former MP have all joined the Congress, literally in the last few months. It does suggest that the people from other parties are seeing the Congress as an inevitable victorious party in Karnataka,\" Tharoor said. He, however, said he was disappointed with the Congress members who had joined the BJP, and said they could have joined a party that shared the values and principles of the Congress instead. He wondered how they could go to a party that has the opposite set of values and principles. \"That I find difficult to understand. That\\'s where my disappointment (lies) with some of the people who have gone to the dark side, as one might say. I think they will sadly have to repent their choices as they see how they are treated in their new home,\" Tharoor said.', 'An engineering seat in a Bengaluru college is reportedly being offered to students for Rs 64 lakh.

The speed of 5G rollout in India \"is the fastest in the world\", SP Kochhar, Director General of Cellular Operators\\' Association of India (COAI) said.  \"When the rollout is taking place in a phased manner, that is, in urban areas first, followed by rural, and not in a heterogeneous manner - the overall benefits of 5G will take some time to arrive,\" Kochhar told PTI.  5G services, in locations rolled out already, are meeting the scientific parameters of ultra high-speed network.  \"Wherever 5G is being rolled out, telecom operators are being very careful that they adhere to quality, as it is in their interest to do so, and the competition is so stiff that they don\\'t want to lose out the business. So they will come out with the best quality, and that they are doing,\" Kocchar said.  5G services which promise turbocharged speeds far greater than 4G, and ultra low latency connectivity, have been rolled out in hundreds of cities in India by telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. According to Kochhar, while players are fully conscious of service quality, some ground realities have to be kept in mind.  \"But a seamless connectivity experience spanning both urban and rural areas might take some time...till the time the entire country gets covered with 5G,\" he said.  Kochhar added: \"Whether it is 4G or 5G there are terrains and obstacles, so obviously you cannot have same quality in all areas. Where there are no obstacles you get a better quality, where there are obstacles, the quality may take some time to pick up.\"  5G networks launched in October are up and running in many locations, and while the service quality norms for these new-age offerings are being worked out, curtailing call drops and improving consumer experience for telecom services in general have been under the government and regulator\\'s constant focus.  The telecom department back in December met operators to discuss rising instances of call drops and service quality-related issues in existing services, as it deliberated on policy measures that can be considered for improving call quality.  Telecom regulator TRAI also called a meeting with telcos in February to discuss measures and action plan for improving service quality, review of norms, as also benchmarks for 5G services.', \"State-owned power giant NTPC on Sunday said its captive coal mines have registered 65 per cent year-on-year production growth to over 23 million tonnes in FY23.

NTPC has also achieved the highest-ever annual overburden removal of 73.0 million cubic metres, representing 129 per cent growth compared to 31.9 million cubic metres of overburden removal in the previous fiscal. The achievement demonstrates NTPC's commitment to increasing its domestic coal production to meet the growing demand for power in the country, the statement said.  NTPC management lauded the role of the power ministry, coal ministry and state governments, among others, for their support to its coal mining in enhancing production and dispatching 21.9 million tonnes of good quality coal to NTPC power plants with a phenomenal year-on-year growth of 48 per cent over coal dispatch of 14.8 million tonnes in the previous fiscal.

Karnataka is headed for assembly polls on May 10.“If Amul sells its milk online for Rs 57 a litre, we will sell our Nandini for Rs 39 a litre,” the Minister said about potential competition from the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation.The KMF was already exporting its produce to the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and other states. “Nandini products are formidable enough to take on Amul products in the market,” he said at a media conference in the BJP party office.On a day, Prime Minster Narendra Modi visited Karnataka, Opposition leader Siddaramaiah said Amul’s online sales in Bengaluru would cut milk procurement by the KMF leading to loss of income for the state’s farmers who were dependent on the dairy sector for livelihood.Milk procurement in Karnataka had been dropping during the BJP rule in the state. Dairy farmers had been suffering after KMF had reduced its procurement from farmers, who were losing an income of Rs 11 a day, the former chief minister said in a statement.Ever since home minister Amit Shah spoke about the cooperation between the two dairy brands in December, the sale of Nandini products has dropped, while that of Amul has picked up, Siddaramaiah alleged.Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, however, said in Bengaluru that, “If we start to get too protectionist, we may not be helping the national economy,” about the controversy, urging the government to take steps to export Nandini to more states.Meanwhile, the Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association has pledged to buy only Nandini products.With the assembly polls weeks away, the Opposition Congress and JDS have stepped up pressure on the BJP-ruled state government to block Amul’s entry into the state and save the local dairy brand. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, however, has ruled out any such possibility.', 'Mounting concerns over the obesity epidemic have led to an increase in the development of drugs aimed at reducing body weight. One such drug that has been making headlines recently is Mounjaro. This antidiabetic injectable drug has been touted as the most powerful weight-loss drug available. In this article, we will explore what Mounjaro is, how it works, and the potential benefits and risks associated with its use.What is Mounjaro?Mounjaro is a prescription antidiabetic drug that has been shown to have weight loss effects. It contains semaglutide, which is a type of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1 receptor agonists work by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a hormone that is released in response to food intake.How Does Mounjaro Work?Mounjaro works by reducing appetite and increasing feelings of fullness. It does this by binding to GLP-1 receptors in the brain, which regulates appetite and food intake. Mounjaro also slows down the rate at which food moves through the stomach, which helps to reduce hunger.Potential Benefits of MounjaroMounjaro has been shown to be effective in reducing body weight in clinical trials. In one study, patients who took Mounjaro lost an average of 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than those who received a placebo. Mounjaro has also been shown to have positive effects on blood sugar control and cholesterol levels.Potential Risks of MounjaroLike all drugs, Mounjaro carries some risks. The most common side effects of Mounjaro include nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. There is also a risk of developing pancreatitis, a serious inflammation of the pancreas. Additionally, Mounjaro has not been studied extensively in pregnant women, so it is not recommended for use during pregnancy.Another concern is the cost of Mounjaro, which is currently quite high. This may limit its availability and accessibility to those who need it the most.ConclusionMounjaro has shown promise as a powerful weight-loss drug that can help to reduce body weight and improve blood sugar control. However, it is not without risks and side effects. As with any medication, it is important to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a healthcare professional to determine if it is a suitable treatment option. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as healthy eating and regular exercise should also be incorporated into weight-loss efforts.', 'In Japan, an estimated 1.5 million working age people are living in isolation, a phenomenon known as hikikomori. Hikikomori is a term used to describe people who have withdrawn from society, often for a period of six months or longer. This trend has raised concerns about the mental health and social well-being of Japan\\'s population.  A poll in Japan is first official comprehensive probe into the prevalence of \"hikikomori\", or \"shut-ins\" -- a phenomenon affecting a broad swathe of society, from teens to the elderly. Reasons for retreating from the country\\'s notoriously conformist and work-focused society range from unemployment to depression or bullying at school or in the workplace.What is Hikikomori?The term hikikomori was coined in Japan in the 1990s to describe young adults who had withdrawn from society and remained isolated in their homes for extended periods. Hikikomori is not recognized as a clinical diagnosis but is rather a social phenomenon that affects people of all ages.Hikikomori can be triggered by a variety of factors, including social anxiety, depression, academic pressure, and bullying. It is often accompanied by other mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Hikikomori range from people who only go out to shop for groceries or to pursue hobbies, to more extreme cases who rarely leave their homes at all.Why are So Many Japanese Living in Isolation?Several factors have contributed to the high prevalence of hikikomori in Japan. The country\\'s highly competitive and demanding education system is one of the key factors. Many young people in Japan face intense academic pressure to succeed in school and secure good jobs, leading to high levels of stress and anxiety.As per government survey, the most common reason respondents gave for their social withdrawal was \"quitting jobs\". This was closely followed by the pandemic, which was cited as the main reason by 18 percent of recluses aged 15-39 and 20 percent of those aged 40-64.The traditional Japanese family structure has also played a role. In Japan, there is a strong emphasis on filial piety, or respect for one\\'s parents and elders. This has led to a culture in which children often feel a sense of obligation to care for their parents in old age, which can cause feelings of guilt and anxiety.Additionally, Japan\\'s work culture is notorious for being intense and all-consuming. Long working hours, high levels of stress, and limited opportunities for career advancement can cause burnout and contribute to the prevalence of hikikomori.What Are the Consequences of Hikikomori?The consequences of hikikomori can be severe, both for individuals and for society as a whole. Hikikomori can lead to social isolation, a lack of employment opportunities, and financial hardship. It can also result in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety disorders.The Japanese government has recognized the problem of hikikomori and has implemented several initiatives to address it. These initiatives include counseling services, support groups, and financial assistance for individuals and families affected by hikikomori.', \"In today's digital age, data is one of the most important assets a business or individual can possess.

To prevent this, restrict background data usage for apps. This will save your data and battery.\", \"Members of the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), who were in service on or after September 1, 2014, have won a hard-fought battle for higher pension in the Supreme Court, but it now appears as if it might be almost impossible for them to reap the reward. It is a tough task for most EPF members to apply for the higher pension from the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) by opting for higher EPS contribution as per their actual basic salary, though the Supreme Court order dated November 4, 2022, had allowed it. A complex web of bureaucratic hurdles prevent eligible employees and employers from exercising the higher pension option by filing a joint application. Let us understand why employees and employers are unable to apply for the higher EPS pension.Online link activated to apply for joint employee employer application for higher EPS pensionThe Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had activated an online link for the employee and employer to fill the joint application form. The last date for this application is May 3, 2023. Though the EPFO has tried its best to make the online process smooth and user friendly, the problem lies in the conditions it has stipulated in the online application form. Provide proof for contribution higher than wage ceilings of Rs 5,000/Rs 6,500When you go online to fill the joint application, it asks for details of your past contributions. The rules mandate that an employee and employer have to jointly request the PF Commissioner to authorise the higher contribution in the EPF account, above the prevailing wage ceiling. However, rarely has anyone followed this procedure as higher contributions were made without requiring this permission. Further, the EPFO itself does not stress on this joint request to make higher contributions in the EPF account. But the joint application form for higher pension asks you if you have contributed a higher amount or not. The problem when you declare ‘Yes’ for past higher contributionIf you had actually contributed more than the prevailing wage ceilings (Rs 5,000 or Rs 6,500), then you have to select the option “Yes”. However, the moment you select that, the next point in the declaration asks you to submit the proof of permission received from the PF authority concerned. Hardly anyone would have this. So, if you say “Yes” but do not share the proof of permission, the EPFO can declare your application as invalid.  Employee may want to proceed with a ‘Yes’ even without any proof of submission, but no employer will be willing to join the employee in this application that makes the submission that higher EPF contribution was made without PF commissioner’s approval.The problem with declaring “No” for past higher contributionIf an individual had not gotten any permission and does not have the permission letter, they might think that they should select the option “No”. However, Point no. 5 of the declaration states: “I hereby undertake that the service details in the above form are correct, and no material fact has been misrepresented or hidden by me.” So, a “No” will be tantamount to hiding material information about past higher contributions. The EPFO can reject the application on this account. Even if an employee is willing to proceed with a “No”, no employer would be willing to join the employee in this application that says no higher EPF contribution was made, as it states a fact to the contrary.Is EPFO right in asking for proof when it knows there is hardly any? Experts weigh in  Nandini Gore, Senior Partner, Karanjawala & Co: It is pertinent to note that when the EPF Scheme came into the existence in 1992, paragraph 26(6) of the scheme said employees whose salary exceeds Rs 5,000 were eligible to be a member of the scheme by a joint declaration of the employer and the employee, and subject to the approval by the assistant commissioner of Provident Fund. However, when the EPS Scheme-1995 was introduced, employees drawing more than Rs 5,000 were not excluded. Further, it was provided that out of the employer’s share of the PF, 8.33% of the capped salary would be transferred to the pension fund and the ceiling limit was increased to Rs 6,500 till August 31, 2014. Thereafter, through an amendment dated August 22, 2014, employees drawing a salary of more than Rs 15,000 were required to exercise a fresh option to continue contributing towards their pension scheme on their actual salary with effect from September 1, 2014. In a circular dated January 22, 2019, the EPFO relaxed the requirement of the joint option. However, this circular was withdrawn within a month. So this relaxation has failed to come into play and the online form still requires permission under paragraph 26(6) of EPF Scheme. Therefore, it is mandatory for employees to seek an undertaking or submit a joint declaration with the employer for obtaining the higher pension. Thus, the employer is required to provide an undertaking that the employee is contributing to EPF on their actual salary as per paragraph 26(6) of the EPF Scheme and the employer is also contributing an equal share, which is in line with the amendment dated August 22, 2014, and a complete joint declaration must be submitted. This is a subversion of the judgment of the Supreme Court as the requirement of submitting proof of Form 26(6) for any higher EPF deduction in the past has not been mentioned in the judgment. Sowmya Kumar, Partner, IndusLaw: The Supreme Court did not make a reference to para 26(6) of the EPF Scheme, which says employers and employees had to make a joint request to contribute on a higher sum. However, the judgment directed the EPFO to address the several practical challenges that may arise once employees choose to opt for the higher pension. Given this, the EPFO has built in several procedural requirements, including proof that a request under para 26(6) had to be made before the employees became eligible for the higher pension. While, in theory, the EPFO can ask for this joint request, the EPFO is well aware that, in practice, compliance with this requirement has not been widespread. In fact, in January 2019, the EPFO had itself clarified that when higher contributions have been deposited even without this request, by the sheer action of the employer and employee, it should be inferred that a joint request for higher contributions had been made. Insisting on this compliance now seems to be a divergence from the earlier EPFO position. Anshul Prakash, Partner, Employment Labour & Benefits, Khaitan & Co: Do note that while there is no express mention of a joint application having been filed earlier by the eligible employees under the EPF Scheme in the judgment of the Supreme Court, the EPFO has wide discretion to seek such proof from its members to ascertain the eligibility and compliance with the conditions set out under the EPF Scheme. That said, and considering that most eligible employees had not filed such applications, and that several questions are being raised on the procedural nuances, we expect the EPFO to issue further clarification on this issue. Nandini Gore, Senior Partner, Karanjawala & Co: The employer is required to provide an undertaking that the employee is contributing to EPF on their actual salary as per paragraph 26(6) of EPF Scheme and an equal share is also contributed by the employer which is in line with amendment dated 22.08.2014 and a complete joint declaration must be submitted. This requirement is a subversion of the judgment of the Supreme Court as the requirement of submitting proof of Form 26(6) for any higher EPF deduction in the past is not mentioned in the judgment. Dorothy Thomas, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co: While the Supreme Court’s decision does not detail the procedural aspects, the EPF Commissioner and authorities have to take into consideration the difficulties faced by employees (i) who while in service had withdrawn the provident fund by way of a loan (for the construction of a house or for medical expenses, etc.); (ii) who have retired, are eligible to claim the higher pension but will have multiple difficulties in collecting these documents and information; (iii) who have worked with multiple employers. Several organisations have already issued notices and filed writ petitions against the Union government and the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner challenging the requirement to furnish proof that employees paid a higher provident fund contribution under para 26 (6) of the EPF Scheme and that they should not be restricted to by a last date. The road ahead The matter has again reached the court, which may offer more clarity on this issue. Moreover, according to a report by TOI on March 29, Union Labour Minister and Chairman of the EPFO's Central Board of Trustees, Bhupender Yadav — when presented with the problem faced by EPFO members in the joint application process —directed the EPFO to take any steps necessary to ensure ease of compliance, especially on the mandatory documentation front. Let us see if any of these work out in favour of the employees and if they will get the higher pension which they have been so eagerly waiting for.\", \"The Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are part of India's soft power, boosting India's global image as well as adding to its diplomatic heft. But they hold a hard power too — the power of money. Inward remittances, or the money they send back to their families and relatives in India, bolster India's economy by fattening its foreign exchange reserves and ensure India's macroeconomic stability. They also fuel consumption and investment in India. India's inward gross remittances touched an all-time high of $107.5 billion during calendar year 2022, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced yesterday. The remittances have overshot the World Bank projection by $7.5 billion.And that, besides other factors, has helped India's forex reserves to jump back to $600 billion now after nearly a year. Forex reserves have again crossed the $600-billion mark with the exchange rate stabilising and record remittance flows. Reserves had crossed the $600-billion mark for the first time in June 2021 and touched a high of $642 billion in September 2021 before slipping below that level in May 2022 when the rupee came under pressure following the Ukraine invasion. Forex reserves fund imports, most crucial of them being oil; help the government pay off its external debt; and strengthen India's currency. Remittances are a macroeconomic cushionRemittances account for a significant chunk of nearly 3% of India’s GDP. They are a buffer to India’s external sector, which has been stressed recently due to various global economic woes. When India's trade deficit widens, remittances provide a much-needed cushion. being the second largest source of external financing after service exports. Lately, India's external trade position got stable with narrowing of merchandise trade deficit, higher services exports and, of course, more-than-expected remittance growth.

Why remittances are set to growIn 2021, India had received $89.4 billion in remittances, according to a World Bank report, which made India the top recipient globally. The World Bank had projected India's remittance flows to soar to $100 billion in 2022, growing at 12 per cent compared to 7.5 per cent in 2021. Reasons for the recent rise in remittances are the changing profile of the NRIs and a structural shift in destinations. With a share of 23 percent of total remittances, the United States has surpassed the United Arab Emirates as the top source country for India's remittances in 2020–21, says the World Bank report. Remittances have benefitted from a gradual shift in Indian migrants’ job profiles — from low-skilled, informal employment in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to high-skilled jobs in high-income countries such as the US, the UK, and those in East Asia (Singapore, Japan, Australia, New Zealand). Between 2016–17 and 2020–21, the share of remittances from the US, the UK, and Singapore increased from 26 percent to over 36 percent, while the share from the five GCC countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar) dropped from 54 to 28 percent, according to an RBI survey. This shows more remittances from well-off NRIs than those at lower rungs. The NRIs, especially in the US, are gradually clawing up the social ladder, which means they are increasingly sending more money home. According to the US Census, of the approximately 5 million Indians in the US in 2019, about 57 percent had lived there for more than 10 years. During this time, many earned graduate degrees that groomed them to move rapidly into the highest-income-earner category, says the World Bank report.The Indian diaspora in the US is highly skilled. In 2019, 43 percent of Indian-born residents of the US had a graduate degree, compared to only 13 percent of US-born residents. Only 15 percent of Indian-born residents aged 25 and older had no more than a high school degree, compared to 39 percent of US-born residents in that age group. Meanwhile, 82 percent of all Indians in the US (compared to 72 percent of all Asians) and 77 percent of foreign-born Indians were proficient in English. Higher education translates to high income levels, with direct implications for remittance flows. In 2019, the median household income for Indians in the US was nearly $120,000 compared to about $70,000 for all Americans. The structural shift in qualifications and destinations has accelerated growth in remittances tied to high-salaried jobs, especially in services. A rising preference among Indian students for studying in developed countries will only add to the trend of high social mobility among NRIs in the US. As NRIs earn more, especially in the developed countries, remittances are set to grow too.India's grab for the NRI moneyIndia can attract more NRI money with modern fintech tools such as the UPI linkages which prove faster and cheaper than the traditional money transfer systems such as the SWIFT. The recent UPI linkage with Singapore's PayNow for faster and cheaper cross-border funds transfers through mobile apps is a step in that direction. The cost of international money transfer is nearly 5% which the India-Singapore linkage can cut to less than half. This is expected to boost India's inward remittances. A cheaper and faster way to transfer money from abroad to India will surely help. If the Singapore model works, it can be replicated with a large number of other countries.\", 'Raghuram Rajan — the former International Monetary Fund chief economist who predicted the global financial crisis more than a decade ago — warned that the banking system is headed for more turmoil after the rescues of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse.Rajan, who was also governor of Reserve Bank of India, said a decade of easy money and a flood of liquidity from central banks has caused an “addiction” and a fragility within the financial system as policy makers tighten policy.“I hope for the best but expect that there might be more to come, partly because some of what we saw was unexpected,” Rajan said in an interview in Glasgow. “The entire concern is that very easy money (and) high liquidity over a long period creates perverse incentives and perverse structures that become fragile when you reverse everything.”His comments add to warnings that the troubles at SVB and Credit Suisse are indicative of deeper underlying problems in the financial system.While IMF chief economist in 2005, Rajan gave a prescient warning on the banking sector ahead the global financial crisis in a Jackson Hole speech that prompted former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to call him a “luddite.” Rajan, now a professor at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, also won acclaim for his handling of the Indian economy while leading its central bank from 2013 to 2016.Bank shares slumped following the crises at SVB and Credit Suisse but central banks have pushed ahead with policy tightening to rein in inflation.Rajan said central bankers have been given a “free ride” as policy makers rapidly reverse the ultra-accommodative stance taken in the decade following the financial crisis.“This sense that the spillover effects of monetary policy are huge and aren’t dealt with by ordinary supervision has just escaped our consciousness over the last so many years,” Rajan said.He said banks are vulnerable to unwinding after central banks “flooded the system with liquidity.”“It’s an addiction that you’ve forced into the system because you flood the system with low return liquid assets and banks are saying, ‘we’ve got to hold this, but what do we do with it? Let’s find ways to make money off it’ and that gives makes them vulnerable to the withdrawal of liquidity.”', \"Singapore government owned fund Temasek Holdings has acquired India's leading hospital chain Manipal Health Enterprises by owning about 59% stake. Temasek-owned Sheares Health, which held 18% stake in Manipal, has acquired an additional 41% stake from the promoters and existing investors. The deal has valued the hospital chain at Rs40,000 crore ($5 bn) of enterprise value, said multiple people aware of the development.Post transaction, stake held by Manipal Health promoter Ranjan Pai & family will be reduced to 30% while stake owned by existing investor TPG will be 11%. The Pai family, which founded India’s first privately owned medical college in Karnataka’s Manipal town in 1953, held 52% stake in the entity.Existing private equity investor of Manipal - TPG Capital Management has sold 11% stake from their 22% stake while other investor National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) has fully exited by selling their 8% stake in the hospital chain, said sources.An official announcement is expected by next week.Temasek Holdings will raise its stake in Manipal Health Enterprises to about 51% from the current 18%, making it the largest investor in India's biggest hospital chain, ET first reported in January.Temasek has pipped global private equity firm KKR & Co who had plans to acquire up to 48% stake in the South-based hospital chain. KKR was also negotiating with the promoters Pai family for buying out a minority stake and ending up owning about 52% stake, ET reported in October.Mails sent to Manipal, TPG and NIIF did not elicit any response while a Temasek spokesperson declined to comment.TPG invested $146 million in Manipal in 2015 and was the first to start a formal process to exit its exposure in Manipal. NIIF had invested Rs 2,100 crore to acquire about 8% stake in Manipal Hospitals through its Strategic Opportunities Fund in April last year.Recently, Manipal Health Enterprise acquired the Kolkata-based AMRI (Advanced Medical Research Institute) Hospitals, in a deal worth Rs2400 crore, and is waiting for the approval from the West Bengal government. The WB government owns about 2% stake in AMRI.The buyout of AMRI will add another 1,200 beds to the Manipal group’s hospital portfolio, taking the total number to about 9,500 beds. At present, it has nearly 8,300 beds across 28 hospitals.Manipal Health is also the top contender to acquire about 70% in KIMS Health Management, Kerala’s leading hospital chain from private equity investor True North. Once the KIMS Kerala deal materialises, Manipal Health will become the largest hospital chain in India with 10,800 beds.Manipal Health has been expanding its footprints across the country through multiple buyouts.In 2020, Manipal Health had acquired the Indian assets of Columbia Asia Hospitals for around Rs 2,100 crore and in June 2021, it bought out Bengaluru-based Vikram Hospitals from Multiple Private Equity for around Rs 350 crore.The hospital industry is expected to post occupancy levels of 62-64 per cent in FY23 and FY24 backed by continued healthy demand for elective surgeries, recovery in medical tourism to pre-Covid levels and continued market share gains for organised players, said rating agency ICRA in a January report.Improving payor mix, growth in surgery volumes, price revisions by companies to offset cost inflation and faster throughput in discharges are expected to aid healthy growth of 8-10% in average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB).A 2020 Human Development Report showed that India ranked 155th in bed availability with five beds and 8.6 doctors per 10,000 people. India needs to add 3.6 million beds, 3 million doctors and 6 million nurses over the next 20 years with an investment of $245 billion, said a PWC report.\", 'Easter is a time of joy, hope, and renewal.

Indian Railways has issued an order putting on hold any fresh applications for induction of wagons. “Around 100 such privately owned rakes (one rake has 40-60 wagons) have already been inducted onto the Indian Railways network. Another 500 rakes are under various stages of approval under the scheme,” another official said.Need to Expand Track Network, Says IndustryThe applications already admitted will continue to get incentives and approvals, he added.Typically, a railway rake moves from point A to B where it unloads the cargo, and then moves to point C where it reloads for the return journey. The private sector, however, does not load on return journeys, and the movement of empty rakes is seen as causing congestion.The General Purpose Wagon Investment Scheme has found takers in the private sector since its rollout in April 2018. The scheme — launched to attract private investment in wagons to reduce shortages — offers a host of concessions, including discounts on freight tariffs and provides branding rights.The discounted tariff is available until the company recovers its capital cost.The demand for private wagons spikes during peak power consumption months when Indian Railways’ own wagons are largely allocated for coal, leaving less capacity for other commodities such as cement and steel.The industry says there is a need to expand the track network through greater private participation.According to Seshagiri Rao, chief financial officer (CFO) at JSW Group, there is a need to speedily build a network in congested areas and the Railways can introduce private sector participation in building them.“Today around 80% of railway traffic is moving on just 51% of the network,” he told ET.Animesh Gupta, president and group chief logistics officer at JSPL, noted that rakes available to private players were to go up significantly with the implementation of GPWIS.“But instead, Railways reduced the rakes for private players as the GPWIS rakes started being inducted,” he said in a recent presentation made to rail ministry officials.Tata Steel said the moratorium will have limited impact since it applies only to the induction of fresh rakes.In an emailed response, a Tata Steel spokesperson said that wagon availability on Indian Railways is expected to improve, easing the need for private wagons.', 'The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed its first chargesheet against the former MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar, her businessman husband, Deepak Kochhar, and Videocon group founder VN Dhoot, in a loan fraud case, sources privy to the development told ET.These sources added that the chargesheet has been filed against nine entities, including both companies and individuals, before a special CBI court in Mumbai. \"The chargesheet was filed last week but it hasn\\'t been taken cognizance of by the court for want of prosecution sanction. The agency has sent a request to the bank to grant sanction to prosecute Chanda Kochhar, response to which is still awaited,\" said a source privy to the development. Cognizance by the court is a must to start a trial. An email sent to ICICI bank remained unanswered till press time A sanction is needed to prosecute a person under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act. Other than the sections under the PC Act, the CBI has invoked certain sections under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by a banker). This section carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. \\'Request to Grant Sanction Sent\\'  \"Ordinarily in CBI cases pertaining to white-collar offence, if sanction to prosecute is not granted by the authority concerned, the court remits the case to a magistrate court as most of the time the IPC sections invoked carry a sentence of less than seven years. However, in this case, it will still stand a trial by sessions court as 409 of the IPC carries a sentence of life imprisonment,\" explained a lawyer who did not wish to be named. While contesting Kochhar\\'s remands in the special CBI court and seeking bail in the Bombay HC, her counsel Amit Desai had referred to a communique sent by the bank to CBI \"granting prosecution sanction\". \"....the loans under probe were extinguished and no wrongful loss has been caused to the bank\", her lawyer had argued quoting the bank\\'s communication to the CBI received in July 2021. \"...due process was followed while granting the loans\" but \"considering the allegations of bribery and corruption, we accord sanction\", Desai had contended then, quoting the bank.An official privy to the development explained: \"...That wasn\\'t the letter granting sanction to prosecute Kochhar. It was a communique sent by the bank as a part of queries sent by the agency. Request to grant sanction to prosecute has been sent now.\"In December 2022, the CBI arrested the Kochhars and Dhoot in connection with a loan of more than ₹1,800 crore sanctioned by ICICI to Videocon group of companies when Chanda Kochhar was at the helm of the bank. The FIR in the matter was registered in 2019.The agency, while seeking their remands, had told the court that between June 2009 and October 2011, ICICI had sanctioned rupee term loan of ₹1,875 crore to six companies of Videocon group to enable them to repay unsecured loans availed of by these companies from Videocon Industries Limited. In lieu of these loans, the Kochhars received ₹64 crore as loan to Deepak Kochhar\\'s NuPower Renewables Ltd and a flat in south Mumbai for ₹11 lakh in 2016 (valued at ₹5.25 core). The CBI says that these are bribes. However, in January, the division bench of Justice Revati Mohite Dere and Justice Prithvi Raj Chavan, while granting bail to the Kochhars, held that the CBI\\'s investigation was in violation of the provisions of law and \"clearly without application of mind\". It also observed that the grounds for arresting the couple, as stated in the arrest memo, was \"casual, mechanical and perfunctory\".Earlier, the CBI, while contesting Dhoot\\'s bail plea, had informed the HC that it has evidence suggesting \"coercion\" by Deepak Kochhar that made Dhoot transfer a plush apartment in south Mumbai to a Kochhar-owned family trust. According to the CBI\\'s court filings reviewed by ET, Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar were engaged in civil litigation since 2003 over a payment of ₹5.38 crore and interest thereupon sought by Dhoot from Deepak Kochhar in respect to the south Mumbai flat, in CCI Chambers. On April 8, 2009, the suit was disposed of by filing of consent terms by Videocon Industries Ltd and Deepak Kochhar\\'s Credential Finance Ltd for conveying the title of property to a Videocon-nominated company by way of conveyance deed. In May of that year, Chanda Kochhar was appointed as the MD & CEO of ICICI Bank. In August, the flat was transferred to Quality Appliance Pvt Ltd, a Videocon-nominated company, by Credential Finance. Subsequently, in 2016, all shares of Quality Appliance Pvt Ltd were purchased by the family trust of Deepak Kochhar - Quality Advisor- for₹11 lakh.'], 'Link':
